# AGENTS.md — Model Apps Plugin

This file provides guidance to AI Agents when working with the **model-apps** plugin.

## What This Plugin Is

A plugin for building and deploying Power Apps generative pages (genux) for model-driven apps. Uses React 17 + TypeScript + Fluent UI V9 single-file components, deployed via PAC CLI.

The `/genpage` skill orchestrates specialist agents: a planner (requirements + plan approval), an optional entity builder (Dataverse entity creation via the plugin's own Node.js Web API scripts), and parallel page builders (code generation).

**Requirements:**
- **PAC CLI ≥ 2.7.0** — for app and page deploy operations
- **Azure CLI (`az`)** — used by entity-builder for Dataverse Web API auth; must be logged in with the same identity as the active `pac` profile

No Dataverse Skills plugin or Python dependency.

## Local Development

Test this plugin locally:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugins/model-apps
```

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/genpage` | Build and deploy generative pages for a model-driven Power App |

## Agents

Agents are invoked by skills via the `Task` tool — they are not user-invocable.

| Agent | Invoked By | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `genpage-planner` | `genpage` (create flow) | Validates prereqs, gathers requirements, detects entity/app existence, presents plan for approval, writes `genpage-plan.md` |
| `genpage-entity-builder` | `genpage` (create flow) | Creates Dataverse tables, columns, relationships, choices, and sample data via the plugin's Node.js Web API scripts (`scripts/`). Bulk inserts use OData `$batch`. Writes a transactional log for recovery |
| `genpage-page-builder` | `genpage` (create flow) | Generates one complete `.tsx` page from the plan and schema; runs in parallel with other builders for multi-page requests |
| `genpage-edit-planner` | `genpage` (edit flow) | Reads the downloaded page artifacts (page.tsx, config.json, prompt.txt), gathers change requirements, presents edit plan, writes `genpage-edit-plan.md`. The orchestrator applies the edit inline. |

## Key Concepts

### Genux Pages

Generative pages (genux) are React 17 + TypeScript single-file components that run inside model-driven Power Apps. They use Fluent UI V9 for styling and the DataAPI for Dataverse data access. Each page is a single `.tsx` file with `export default GeneratedComponent`.

### DataAPI

The DataAPI (`props.dataApi`) provides typed CRUD operations against Dataverse tables. It uses RuntimeTypes.ts (generated by `pac model genpage generate-types`) for type safety. Column names must be verified from the generated schema — never guessed.

### RuntimeTypes

TypeScript type definitions generated from Dataverse metadata. Contains entity types, enum registrations, and the `GeneratedComponentProps` interface. Generated via PAC CLI before code generation to ensure correct column names.

## Development Standards

- **React 17 + TypeScript** — all generated code
- **Fluent UI V9** — `@fluentui/react-components` exclusively (DatePicker from `@fluentui/react-datepicker-compat`, TimePicker from `@fluentui/react-timepicker-compat`)
- **Single file architecture** — all components, utilities, styles in one `.tsx` file
- **No external libraries** — only React, Fluent UI V9, approved Fluent icons, D3.js for charts
- **Type-safe DataAPI** — use RuntimeTypes when Dataverse entities are involved
- **Responsive design** — flexbox, relative units, never `100vh`/`100vw`
- **Accessibility** — WCAG AA, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, semantic HTML
- **Complete code** — no placeholders, TODOs, or ellipses in final output

## Skill Authoring Guidelines

- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines
- Use short, descriptive `name` field (e.g., `genpage`)
- Write descriptions in third person ("Creates X" not "This skill guides you through creating X")
- Use progressive disclosure: SKILL.md for workflow, reference files for details
- Link to references inline: `See [troubleshooting.md](../../references/troubleshooting.md)`

## Testing Changes

After modifying this plugin:

1. Run `claude --debug` to see plugin loading details
2. Run `node --test plugins/model-apps/scripts/tests/*.test.js` (must pass)
3. Run `node --test evals/model-apps/genpage/tests/*.test.js` (must pass)
4. Run both eval-suite runners against shipping fixtures (Layer 1 + Layer 2):
   - `node evals/model-apps/genpage/run-layer-1.js --tier smoke`
   - `node evals/model-apps/genpage/run-layer-2.js --tier smoke`
5. Test skill invocation with `/genpage`
6. Test with both Dataverse entity pages and mock data pages (smoke + edit)
7. Verify Playwright browser verification works (navigate, snapshot, click, screenshot)

## Eval Suite

The plugin has a 3-layer eval suite under `evals/model-apps/genpage/`. Two
layers are automated (TAP v13 runners); Layer 3 is manual.

- **Comprehensive guide:** `evals/model-apps/genpage/EVAL_GUIDE.md` — what
  we evaluate, the 3 layers, tiers (smoke/full/stress), fixture types
  (synthetic vs real captures), runner output, capture flow, cadence,
  diagnosing failures, adding evals and assertions.
- **Eval definitions:** `evals/model-apps/genpage/evals.json` — 16 evals
  with prompts, answers, and expectations.
- **Fixtures:** `evals/model-apps/genpage/fixtures/<eval-id>-<slug>/` —
  one folder per captured or synthetic run. Each contains the `.tsx`,
  `workflow-log.md`, `genpage-plan.md`, and (when applicable)
  `entity-creation-log.md` and `RuntimeTypes.ts`.

Run on every PR that touches the skill, agents, rules, or evals:

```bash
node evals/model-apps/genpage/run-layer-1.js --tier smoke
node evals/model-apps/genpage/run-layer-2.js --tier smoke
```
