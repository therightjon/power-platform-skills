# Changelog

All notable changes to the **model-apps** plugin.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-05-13

Replaces the Dataverse MCP server + Python SDK fallback with Node.js Web API
scripts. Adds solution selection, prefix discipline, and a consolidated auth
pre-flight. Trim of ~27K tokens on hot-path page-builder runs.

### Breaking
- **Azure CLI (`az`) is now required** for entity creation. The `az` identity
  must have access to the target Dataverse env (same as the active `pac` profile).
- **Dataverse Skills plugin is no longer required.** Soft dep removed.
- `.env`, `scripts/auth.py`, and device-code prompts from the Dataverse Skills
  plugin no longer used.

### Added
- Node.js Web API scripts under `plugins/model-apps/scripts/`:
  `check-auth.js`, `dataverse-request.js`, `create-table.js`, `add-column.js`,
  `create-relationship.js`, `create-record.js` (with `$batch` bulk),
  `create-solution.js`, `add-to-solution.js`, `lib/dataverse-auth.js`.
- Solution selection in planner with prefix-conflict warnings.
- Transactional log at `<working-dir>/entity-creation-log.md`.
- `node --test` coverage under `scripts/tests/` (47 tests).

### Fixed
- **Prefix drift made structurally impossible.** Plan stores logical-name
  suffixes only; entity-builder constructs `${prefix}_${suffix}` from the
  single `Publisher Prefix:` source of truth.
- **`pac model create` always passes `--solution`.** Default value is `Default`.
  The CLI's "active solution" fallback errors in practice.
- **`--prompt` is now scoped per upload role**: full description on create,
  delta only on every subsequent upload (PAGEREF, fix re-deploy, edit flow).
- **Bulk-insert partial failure** emits structured JSON to stdout (not
  `[object Object]`).
- entity-builder bash snippets no longer mix JS template literals.
- planner no longer shells `grep`/`awk`/`sed` (Windows-incompatible).

### Performance
- Page-builder no longer loads `verified-icons.txt` upfront (~26K tokens
  saved per run). Validation switched to post-write `Grep` only.
- `rules.md` trimmed −98 lines: dropped duplicated DataAPI
  type definitions (canonical source is `RuntimeTypes.ts`); tightened usage
  examples.
- `rules.md` Page Input section trimmed −25 lines: pure prose tighten.
- Phase 7 (browser verification) extracted to `skills/genpage/verify-flow.md`,
  loaded only when the user opts in. SKILL.md trimmed an additional −95 lines.
- Reference docs renamed for consistency:
  `genpage-rules-reference.md` → `rules.md`,
  `genpage-plan-schema.md` → `plan-schema.md`,
  `genpage-localization-reference.md` → `localization.md`,
  `data-caching-pattern.md` → `data-caching.md`.
- Removed stale `samples/3-poa-revocation-wizard.tsx` (327 lines, redundant
  with `2-wizard-multi-step.tsx` for the wizard pattern; the DataGrid /
  file-upload / multiselect patterns it composed are covered by other
  samples). Renumbered 4–8 → 3–7 to close the gap.

### Added (samples)
- `samples/8-dashboard-with-charts.tsx` — KPI cards + two D3 charts (area +
  donut) with the animation guard from rules.md. Covers the dashboard page
  type and the D3 chart pattern that evals 2 and 6 expect.
- `samples/9-list-with-caching.tsx` — list page using Rule 15's window cache
  + inline async IIFE pattern. Cross-page navigation to the detail sample via
  `PAGEREF_` placeholder.
- `samples/10-detail-with-pageinput.tsx` — detail page paired with the list.
  Receives `pageInput.recordId` synchronously, initial `loading: true` on
  frame 0, `Map<recordId, row>` cache on `window`. Demonstrates the
  formatted-value lookup for `_parentcustomerid_value`.
- Added scope headers to `rules.md` "Common Errors" (generation-time
  anti-patterns) and `troubleshooting.md` (deployment/runtime/env) so readers
  can pick the right one without scanning.

### Migration from 2.0
1. `az login` (use the same identity as `pac auth who`).
2. Uninstall the Dataverse Skills plugin if it was only for `/genpage`.
3. No code/page changes needed; existing pages keep working.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-05-12

Major refactor of `/genpage` into an agent-orchestrated architecture.

### Breaking
- **PAC CLI ≥ 2.7.0** required (for `pac model create`, `pac model list-tables --search`).
- Skill output now lives in a per-invocation working directory
  (`genpage-plan.md`, `RuntimeTypes.ts`, one `.tsx` per page, `workflow-log.md`).
- Plan-mode approval is mandatory; no skip/auto-accept.

### Added
- Four specialist agents: `genpage-planner`, `genpage-entity-builder`,
  `genpage-page-builder`, `genpage-edit-planner`.
- Multi-page parallel generation; cross-page navigation via `PAGEREF_<filename>`
  placeholders resolved in Phase 6.5.
- `pac model create` inline app provisioning.
- Plan schema contract at `references/plan-schema.md`.
- Verified Fluent icon list at `references/verified-icons.txt` (~5000 names).
- Eval suite: 16 evals across smoke/full/stress tiers + runbook.

### Changed
- Entity detection uses native `pac model list-tables --search` with exact
  logical-name match.
- Component template destructures `pageInput` in addition to `dataApi`.
- Rules reference adds Rule 14 (batched async state) and Rule 15 (data-fetching
  IIFE + cache guard).

### Migration from 1.x
1. `dotnet tool update --global Microsoft.PowerApps.CLI.Tool` (to ≥ 2.7.0).
2. Existing deployed pages keep working — only local workflow/layout changed.

## 1.0.6 — earlier in 2026

PageInput support, FluentProvider flicker fix, lookup `$select` rule, data
caching pattern. See git history for details.
