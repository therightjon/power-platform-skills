# Approval Gates — Power Pages Skill Catalog (v3)

> **Status: v3 — extended to non-ALM skills.** v2 introduced the marker/lint design and catalogued the 12 ALM skills (§6.1–§6.12). v3 extends coverage to the 12 non-ALM skills (§6.13–§6.24), flips lint severity from warn-only to hard-fail across the plugin, and updates `AGENTS.md` so any new skill must add its gates here in the same PR.
>
> **Scope: all power-pages skills.** §6 enumerates every `AskUserQuestion` across the 24 user-invocable skills (12 ALM + 12 non-ALM). `report-issue` is a cross-plugin shared workflow — its wrapper SKILL.md contains no prompts (the workflow file at `shared/skills/report-issue/report-issue-workflow.md` lives outside the per-plugin lint scope) and is excluded from this catalog.
>
> **Markers applied across all SKILL.md files.** Each gate has both a machine-readable `<!-- gate: ID | category=X | cancel-leaves=Y -->` HTML comment and a human-readable `> 🚦 **Gate (...)**` block. Each pure data-gathering prompt has a `<!-- not-a-gate: <reason> -->` comment.
>
> **Lint is hard-fail for every skill.** `scripts/lint-skills-alm.js` enforces seven gate-related rules at error severity on every SKILL.md under `plugins/power-pages/skills/`: `GATE-must-have-marker`, `GATE-id-must-be-unique`, `GATE-must-be-in-catalog`, `GATE-intent-must-call-helper`, `GATE-cancel-leaves-known-vocab`, `GATE-prose-block-required` (the marker must be followed by a 🚦 prose block within 10 lines, outside any code fence), and `CATALOG-row-must-have-marker` (every `kind: gate` catalog row must have a corresponding marker in some SKILL.md — the reverse of `GATE-must-be-in-catalog`).

## 1. Terminology — is "approval gate" / "review gate" standard?

Short answer: **"gate" has strong industry precedent. "review gate" specifically does not. "Approval gate" is the closest match to widely-used vocabulary.**

| Term | Source | Match for our pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **Approval gate** | Azure DevOps Release Pipelines ("Pre/post-deployment approvals and gates"). Spinnaker "Manual Judgment" stages. GitHub Environments "Required reviewers". | ✅ Closest to our usage. |
| **Deployment gate** | Same CI/CD heritage; often paired with "approval gate". | ✅ Narrower — fits final-deploy consent specifically. |
| **Stage gate** | Robert Cooper's Stage-Gate process (product development, 1986). | ⚠️ Conceptually similar but rooted in NPD, not software. |
| **Phase gate** | Same as stage-gate. Used loosely in PM. | ⚠️ Imprecise. |
| **Human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoint** | AI agent / ML ops vocabulary. | ✅ Captures the philosophy but verbose. |
| **Manual approval / approval step** | GitHub Actions, ADO Classic, Spinnaker. | ✅ Common synonym. |
| **Review gate** | Not a recognized industry term. Some internal change-management usage but no canonical reference. | ❌ Project-specific construction. |

In **Claude Code / Anthropic skills** specifically, there is **no formal name** for this pattern. The mechanism is `AskUserQuestion`. The closest official framing in `PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` is the **Three-Point Approval Pattern** (after discovery, after planning, before deployment) — that's our internal convention, not an Anthropic one.

### Recommendation

Adopt **"Approval Gate"** (capitalized as a proper noun) as the canonical term. Drop "review gate" if it's in informal use. Rationale:

- Strong CI/CD heritage that maps cleanly to ALM skills.
- Concrete: makes clear *someone has to approve*.
- Already the most common existing word in our SKILL.md files (`Phase 0 — ALM plan gate`, `Final deploy consent gate`, `Post-sync approval gate`).
- Composes well with category prefixes (see §3 below).
- Distinct from "checkpoint" (no enforcement implication) and "review" (passive — gates are active blockers).

---

## 2. What an Approval Gate is

An **Approval Gate** is a point in a skill workflow where:

1. The skill **stops** and asks the user a question via `AskUserQuestion`.
2. The skill **cannot proceed past the gate** without an explicit user answer.
3. The blast radius of skipping the gate is **non-trivial**.

**The test:** *"would any state — partial or complete-but-wrong — be left behind if the user answered Cancel at this point, and is that state expensive to undo?"* If yes, it's a gate.

Things that are **not** Approval Gates (and shouldn't be marked as such):

- **Informational sub-prompts** that just shape an upcoming gate's options without changing what gets created. Example: `plan-alm` Phase 2 "Help me decide" expanding to a comparison table is not a gate; the gate is the strategy choice that follows.
- **Free-text fallback prompts** that fill in a missing required field (e.g., "I couldn't auto-detect your site URL — paste it") — these are data-gathering, not approval.
- **Discovery-stage confirmations** that simply confirm what was found, with no side effect to undo.
- **Validation polls** (the user isn't being asked anything).
- **Sync-mode `TaskUpdate` checkpoints**.

When in doubt, apply the test above. Borderline cases get the marker; lint complains only if the marker is missing.

---

## 3. Six gate categories

Each gate fits one of six categories. Each gets a one-word prefix in the marker syntax (§4) so readers and lint can tell them apart at a glance. **The defining attribute** for each category is what distinguishes its blast radius — not just when it fires.

### 3.1 `intent` — Entry / orchestration gate
**Defining attribute:** Helper-script-backed; reads deterministic state from a real script, branches on JSON. Not LLM reasoning.

**Question the user answers:** *"Should this skill even run, given current project state?"*

**Mechanism:** Phase 0 calls a helper (`check-alm-plan.js`); the JSON return value (`{ exists, deferred, stale, ... }`) determines whether to surface the gate or pass through silently. The gate itself is an `AskUserQuestion` *only* when the helper returns a "no plan / stale plan" state.

**Lint implication:** The `intent` marker requires the SKILL.md to invoke a known helper script (one of: `check-alm-plan.js`, `verify-alm-prerequisites.js`, `check-activation-status.js`). Inline LLM-evaluated entry conditions don't qualify.

### 3.2 `plan` — Plan-approval gate
**Defining attribute:** User signs off on a rendered artifact (HTML plan, manifest, parameter table, permissions matrix) *before* the skill writes anything Dataverse-side.

**Question the user answers:** *"Does this match what you wanted to do?"*

**Mechanism:** Skill presents a rendered artifact and a 2–4 option `AskUserQuestion`. Cancel exits without any Dataverse / filesystem write.

> **Deploy-dispatch prompts ("Deploy now?") are `plan`, not `consent`.** Many non-ALM skills (`create-site:8.deploy`, `add-server-logic:11.3.deploy`, `add-cloud-flow:8.4.deploy`, etc.) end with a "Deploy now / Later" prompt that invokes `/deploy-site`. These are `plan` gates — the user is choosing *whether to dispatch a child skill*, not approving the destructive action itself. The destructive Dataverse write lives inside `/deploy-site`'s own `consent` gate at `deploy-site:3.confirm-env`, which echoes the target env and requires explicit confirmation. The pattern is dispatch-then-consent: `plan` here, `consent` there. Compare `deploy-site:6.2.unblock-js` (`consent`, modifies tenant-wide `blockedattachments`) — that one IS destructive at its call site and is tagged accordingly. If a future "Deploy now?" prompt skips the dispatch and writes directly to Dataverse, retag it `consent`.

### 3.3 `progress` — Mid-flow re-confirmation gate
**Defining attribute:** A condition emerged mid-run that wasn't visible at planning time; the user re-confirms before the skill continues with the delta.

**Question the user answers:** *"The situation changed — proceed with the new state?"*

**Mechanism:** Triggered by a detected condition (sync mode happened; new components were adopted; pre-flight found a gap). Skill pauses and re-prompts with the delta surfaced inline.

### 3.4 `consent` — Destructive / irreversible-action gate
**Defining attribute:** The action being approved changes **shared or irreversible state** — a tenant-wide security setting, a permanent naming choice, a cross-host stamp move, a managed-vs-unmanaged export choice. Distinguishing factor is **what kind of state changes**, not when in the flow.

**Question the user answers:** *"This is destructive / irreversible — really proceed?"*

**Mechanism:** Mandatory `AskUserQuestion` with consequences spelled out. Often non-skippable even when other flags pre-confirmed upstream. The "no `--yes` flag" rule applies.

> **Note:** Both proactive (pre-flight) and reactive (after-failure) modifications of the same shared state are `consent` gates. Trigger timing doesn't change the category — `deploy-pipeline:2.5` (pre-flight unblock of `blockedattachments`) and `deploy-pipeline:7.6.2` (reactive unblock after `AttachmentBlocked` failure) both modify a tenant-wide setting and are therefore both `consent`.

### 3.5 `final` — Last-call gate
**Defining attribute:** Immediately before the destructive API call. No work happens between the gate and the call except the call itself.

**Question the user answers:** *"Ready to ship?"*

**Mechanism:** Distinct from `consent` in that the destructive action has already been agreed in principle (often by upstream `plan` and `progress` gates) — this gate's job is only to convert that principle-level approval into "fire now" approval. Separates *validation passed* from *user wants to ship*.

### 3.6 `pause` — External-system wait gate
**Defining attribute:** Nothing the *skill* is asking the user about. The *external platform* is requesting a human action (e.g., PPAC approval) and the skill is surfacing that wait through `AskUserQuestion`.

**Question the user answers:** *"Have you done the thing the external system wants?"*

**Mechanism:** Skill polls until external state changes. When the external state is `PendingApproval` / `AwaitingPreDeployApproval`, the skill surfaces it via `AskUserQuestion` and waits. Tooling must never auto-respond to a `pause` gate.

---

### 3.7 Loop semantics — when a gate sits inside a loop

> **The single biggest runtime failure mode of this strategy:** the LLM interprets the user's answer at the top of a loop as covering the *entire loop*, then proceeds through subsequent iterations without re-prompting. Documented runtime example: `deploy-pipeline` Phase 6.0 was skipped for iterations 2 and 3 of a 3-solution `MULTI_RUN_MODE` deploy after the user answered "staging" once at the top. The gate marker was present; the lint passed; the agent simply did not call `AskUserQuestion` again.

The default behavior **per category** when a gate is inside a loop:

| Category | Default when inside a loop | Override? |
|---|---|---|
| `intent` | **Once per skill invocation, before the loop.** Entry gates protect the skill from running with wrong project state — the project state doesn't change between iterations. | Not applicable. |
| `plan` | **Depends on what the gate is choosing.** A "pick a strategy" plan gate runs once before the loop. A "confirm this iteration's parameters" plan gate runs **once per iteration.** Each catalog row must state which. | SKILL.md prose. |
| `progress` | **Per occurrence of the triggering delta.** If sync mode runs twice in a loop, this gate fires twice. If a delta is detected only on iteration 2, it fires only on iteration 2. | Not applicable. |
| `consent` | **PER ITERATION when the destructive action repeats.** Each instance of the destructive call gets its own consent. A consent given for iteration 1 does NOT cover iteration 2 even if the destruction is the same shape. | Hard rule — never override. |
| `final` | **PER ITERATION, full stop.** The whole point of `final` is "fire immediately before the destructive call." If the destructive call runs `N` times in a loop, the gate fires `N` times. | Hard rule — never override. |
| `pause` | **Per occurrence of the external pending state.** Polling can re-enter PendingApproval after a retry; each entry gets its own pause prompt. | Not applicable. |

**Required prose in SKILL.md** for any gate that sits inside a loop:

1. The gate marker block (`> 🚦 **Gate (...)**`) must include an explicit line stating *"Fires PER LOOP ITERATION"* (or equivalent) and naming the loop variable. Example: *"Three solutions in `deploymentOrder` → three Phase 6.0 prompts."*
2. The loop description elsewhere in the SKILL.md must call out the gate by name in the per-iteration sequence. Example: *"For each entry in `DEPLOYMENT_ORDER`: ... fire Phase 6.0 consent gate ... call `DeployPackageAsync`."*
3. The marker block must explicitly negate the most common shortcut: *"The upstream Phase 2 stage selection (whether via interactive prompt or `--stage` argument) does NOT cover subsequent iterations."*

**Why prose, not lint?** The lint catches the *presence* of a marker. It cannot prove the agent actually *fired* the `AskUserQuestion` call at runtime. Loop-semantics prose narrows the LLM's interpretation space so the shortcut becomes textually impossible — *"the gate fires N times for N iterations"* leaves no room to read it as *"once is enough"*.

**Future hardening (out of scope for v2):** runtime telemetry on gate firing — a `gate-fire-log.js` helper the skill calls before each `AskUserQuestion`, with a validator that asserts the expected pattern post-run. That would let us detect runtime non-firing empirically instead of just structurally.

---

## 4. Marker syntax (proposed)

Every gate gets a structural marker in SKILL.md. The marker has two parts: a **machine-readable HTML comment** (lint anchor) and a **human-readable block** (documentation).

### 4.1 The marker

```markdown
<!-- gate: skill-name:phase-id | category=plan | cancel-leaves=nothing -->

> 🚦 **Gate (plan · skill-name:phase-id):** One-line summary of what the user is approving.
>
> **Trigger:** When this gate fires.
> **Why we ask:** What goes wrong if a tool bypasses the prompt.
> **Cancel leaves:** Explicit state description — either `nothing` (clean exit) or a specific state.
```

`skill-name` is kebab-case; `phase-id` matches the SKILL.md phase number (`6.0`, `5.4c`, `q1b`).

### 4.2 Pairing rule (replaces v1's "within 10 lines" proximity rule)

Lint uses the **HTML comment** as the structural anchor, not text proximity. The `AskUserQuestion` block paired with a marker:

- Must appear **after** the marker (anywhere later in the same phase section).
- Has no maximum line distance — rationale prose can be arbitrarily long between marker and `AskUserQuestion`.
- May be followed by sub-`AskUserQuestion` calls (e.g., follow-up free-text input within the same gate); those don't need their own markers if the catalog entry says "may include follow-up data-gathering prompts".

A second `AskUserQuestion` in the same phase section that is **not** covered by an existing marker must have its own marker OR an explicit `<!-- not-a-gate: reason -->` comment justifying why.

### 4.3 `cancel-leaves` field (new in v2)

Required, normalized vocabulary:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `nothing` | Clean exit. No Dataverse write, no filesystem write, no state change anywhere. |
| `validated-stage-run` | A `deploymentstageruns` row remains on the host in validated-but-not-deployed state. |
| `partial-manifest` | `.solution-manifest.json` written but not all components added to Dataverse. |
| `partial-solution` | Some components added to Dataverse via `AddSolutionComponent` before Cancel. |
| `deferral-marker` | `.alm-deferred` file written (an intentional user-facing artifact). |
| `host-binding` | Dev env's `ProjectHostEnvironmentId` org-db setting changed. |
| `attachment-block-modified` | Env's `blockedattachments` setting modified before Cancel. |
| `cross-host-stamp-moved` | Pattern 15 force-link partially completed. |
| `external-state-pending` | Skill cancelled while external system (PP Pipelines) was in `PendingApproval` — the run remains on the host in that state. |
| `invalid-secret-in-file` | `deployment-settings.json` carries Secret values in invalid formats (e.g. `@KeyVault(...)` short-form). Cancel leaves the file as-is so the user can hand-fix with canonical Key Vault URIs. |

Custom values are allowed when none of the above fits — lint accepts any kebab-case slug but flags duplicate slugs across the catalog for de-duplication.

### 4.4 Example — `deploy-pipeline` Phase 6.0

```markdown
<!-- gate: deploy-pipeline:6.0 | category=final | cancel-leaves=validated-stage-run -->

> 🚦 **Gate (final · deploy-pipeline:6.0):** Final consent before DeployPackageAsync.
>
> **Trigger:** Validation passed (Phase 5); no completeness drift outstanding; no env-var override prompts outstanding. About to fire `DeployPackageAsync` or the `pac pipeline deploy` fallback.
> **Why we ask:** Wrong-stage deploy. Non-transactional — partial failure leaves whatever already imported on the target.
> **Cancel leaves:** Validated stage run on host (no `docs/alm/last-deploy.json` written). User can retry by re-invoking `deploy-pipeline`.

[arbitrarily long rationale prose explaining why this gate exists, what alternatives were considered, etc.]

Use `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Ready to deploy `{ARTIFACT_SOLUTION_NAME}` (v`{newVersion}`) to **`{SELECTED_STAGE.name}`** (`{targetEnvUrl}`)?"
>
> Options:
> 1. Deploy now (Recommended)
> 2. Cancel
```

### 4.5 Why an emoji in the human block?

`🚦` (traffic-light) is high-contrast and unusual. Verified: it appears nowhere else in any SKILL.md or reference doc on the current branch, so the grep-safety claim holds today. Plain-text fallback if emoji is undesirable: `[GATE]`. Note that lint anchors on the HTML comment, not the emoji — the emoji is purely for human readability.

---

## 5. Lint rules (proposed)

Add to `scripts/lint-skills-alm.js`:

### `GATE-must-have-marker`
Every `AskUserQuestion` block in an ALM SKILL.md must be preceded (within the same phase section) by either:
- A paired `<!-- gate: ID | category=X | cancel-leaves=Y -->` comment, **or**
- An explicit `<!-- not-a-gate: <reason> -->` comment justifying why.

Pairing is established by section boundary (`### Phase`), not line proximity. Multiple `AskUserQuestion` calls in the same phase may share one marker only if the catalog entry explicitly documents the sub-prompts.

Waivable via `<!-- alm-lint-ignore: GATE-must-have-marker -->`. Tracked in `.almlintignore` for known exceptions.

### `GATE-id-must-be-unique`
The `gate-id` slug must be unique across all SKILL.md files in the plugin.

### `GATE-must-be-in-catalog`
Every `gate-id` in a SKILL.md must appear in §6 of this catalog. Catches drift when a skill adds a gate without documenting it.

Strict for ALM skills (hard-fail). Warn-only for non-ALM skills until the catalog is extended to cover them (§10).

### `GATE-intent-must-call-helper`
A marker tagged `category=intent` must be in a SKILL.md section that invokes a known helper script (one of: `check-alm-plan.js`, `verify-alm-prerequisites.js`, `check-activation-status.js`). Prevents `intent` from being abused as a generic "first prompt" label.

### `GATE-cancel-leaves-known-vocab`
The `cancel-leaves=` value must be one of the §4.3 vocabulary entries or a kebab-case slug. Lint flags duplicate slugs across the catalog for de-duplication.

---

## 6. The ALM-skill catalog

Each section lists every `AskUserQuestion` in that skill. Catalog rows are marked as one of:

- **`gate`** — meets the §2 definition; gets a marker and a lint check.
- **`not-a-gate`** — informational sub-prompt or data-gathering; gets a `<!-- not-a-gate -->` comment.

> **Phase numbers reference the SKILL.md as of branch `users/nityagi/EnvVariableChanges`.** Phase IDs may need re-anchoring if SKILL.md is restructured.

---

### 6.1 `plan-alm` (17 calls; planner)

> `plan-alm` is a **planner** — it produces an approved/draft HTML plan and never executes. The execution gates that used to live in Phases 5–8 (deploy-failure, post-deploy activation, manual export/import checkpoint) now belong to the individual ALM skills the user runs afterward; they are catalogued under those skills' sections, not here.

| ID | Kind | Category | Phase | Trigger / question | Cancel leaves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `plan-alm:1.deferral` | gate | progress | 1 | `.alm-deferred` marker present — *"Continue with deferral / remove and proceed / cancel"* | `deferral-marker` |
| `plan-alm:1.approve-draft` | gate | plan | 1 (0b) | Existing **Draft** plan found — *"Approve this draft now (no re-plan) / re-plan from scratch / cancel"*. Approve writes status via `set-plan-status.js` and exits | nothing |

| `plan-alm:2.q1b-override` | gate | consent | 2 (Q1b) | User picked "keep single" — *"Confirm override + free-text reason"* | nothing |
| `plan-alm:2.q2-strategy` | gate | plan | 2 (Q2) | *"PP Pipelines / Manual export-import / Already have pipeline / Help me decide"* | nothing |
| `plan-alm:2.q3-stages` | gate | plan | 2 (Q3 PP) | *"How many deployment stages?"* | nothing |
| `plan-alm:2.q4-host` | gate | plan | 2 (Q4 PP) | Host environment selection — branched table consuming `HOST_RESOLUTION` status (use-detected / pick from list / NoHost host-type menu / Sandbox confirm / CannotRedirect block / manual paste). Per-stage env URLs are inferred from the Q3 stage-layout answer + `pac env list`, not collected via a separate prompt. | nothing |
| `plan-alm:2.q5-approval` | gate | plan | 2 (Q5 PP) | *"Approvals: required each stage / staging auto + prod required / no gates"* | nothing |
| `plan-alm:2.q3-manual` | gate | plan | 2 (Q3 Manual) | *"How many target envs?"* | nothing |
| `plan-alm:2.q4-manual-target` | gate | plan | 2 (Q4 Manual per stage) | *"URL for target env {N}?"* | nothing |
| `plan-alm:2.q5-manual-type` | gate | plan | 2 (Q5 Manual) | *"Export managed or unmanaged?"* | nothing |
| `plan-alm:4.approve` | gate | plan | 4 | *"Save approved / Save draft / Change something"* — saves the plan; never executes | nothing |
| `plan-alm:4.approver` | not-a-gate | — | 4 | Approver-name capture (option 1 only) — always-on interactive prompt with git/OS-name prefill; data-gathering for the audit trail | — |

### 6.2 `setup-solution` (13 calls)

| ID | Kind | Category | Phase | Trigger / question | Cancel leaves |

Covers sub-prompts: tables multi-select, flows multi-select, bots multi-select, and the closing *"Proceed / change something"* gate. Single marker covers all four because the lint regex matches the closing prompt; the multi-select sub-prompts share the same gate semantics. | partial-manifest |
| `setup-solution:7.next-step` | gate | plan | 7 | *"How to deploy: pipeline / manual / later"* | nothing |

The `6.0.final-consent` marker covers both the `DeployPackageAsync` and `pac pipeline deploy` paths — no separate ID for the CLI fallback.)

The prompt's content varies by pattern; the gate identity does not. Pattern IDs themselves are stable: see `references/deployment-error-catalog.md`.

## 7. How to add a new gate

When introducing a gate in an existing or new ALM skill:

1. **Pick the category** from §3. If it doesn't fit, propose a new one — don't shoehorn.
2. **Pick a gate ID** of the form `skill-name:phase-id` (kebab-case skill name; phase number / step matches the SKILL.md heading).
3. **Add a row to the catalog** (§6 table for the owning skill) with `kind`, `category`, `phase`, trigger, question, `cancel-leaves`.
4. **Add the marker block** in SKILL.md immediately before the (possibly distant) `AskUserQuestion` call. Use both the HTML comment and the human-readable block from §4.1.
5. **If `category=intent`**, ensure the SKILL.md section invokes a helper script (`GATE-intent-must-call-helper` lint rule).
6. **Run** `node scripts/lint-skills-alm.js`.

When **removing** a gate, also remove its catalog row in the same PR.

### 6.24a Security skills — runtime-loop pattern (now anchored)

The four security skills introduced in PR #151 (`manage-firewall`, `manage-headers`, `scan-site`, `security-review`) use `AskUserQuestion` differently from the other skills: most calls happen inside a "recommend then ask" runtime loop that was originally described in prose without a literal `AskUserQuestion`:` call site.

v3 closed this coverage hole by surfacing the recommend-then-ask block as a real call site in the prose:

- `manage-firewall:3.action-choice` (gate, plan) — `### Default approach`; routes to which destructive action runs.
- `manage-firewall:3.execute-consent` (gate, consent) — `### Plan-validate-execute`; final consent before each WAF mutation.
- `scan-site:3.action-choice` (gate, plan) — `### Default approach`; idle/running × has-report/no-report decision.
- `manage-headers:3.per-finding` (gate, plan) — `### Default approach`; per-finding accept / customize / skip loop.
- `security-review:2.1.goal` + `5.3.next-action` (gates, plan) — goal capture + post-report next-action.

The `### Option rules` sections in `manage-firewall` and `scan-site` retain `<!-- not-a-gate -->` markers — they document HOW to construct prompts but aren't call sites themselves.

### 6.30 `scan-code` (3 gate IDs)

New skill (Power Pages source & dependency security scan). Runs local static analysis and dependency/secret/license scanning, then surfaces findings. All gates are `plan` — every prompt configures a read-only scan, so cancelling never leaves behind state to undo.

| ID | Kind | Category | Phase | Trigger / question | Cancel leaves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `scan-code:1.agent-review-fallback` | gate | plan | 1.2 | Offer the high-token agent-driven review when a scanning tool is missing. Fires only on a missing tool, interactive mode only. | nothing |
| `scan-code:2.scope-choice` | gate | plan | 2 (`### Scope selection`, Q1) | *"What to check? Everything / Code only / Packages only"* — selects which scanners run. Skipped in review mode and when the initial request already names the scope. | nothing |
| `scan-code:2.depth-choice` | gate | plan | 2 (`### Scope selection`, Q2) | *"How thorough? Advanced / Basic"* — sets the code-scan depth. Asked only when code checking is included; skipped in review mode. | nothing |

### Cross-plugin shared skills — out of catalog scope

`report-issue` — Its prompts are cross-plugin, not power-pages-specific, so they are not catalogued here. If the shared workflow is ever governed by per-plugin approval-gate linting, add a `report-issue:*` section to this catalog.

---

## 8. Plugin-wide enforcement (was: non-ALM deferral)

> **v3 update.** This section previously listed 13 deferred non-ALM skills. Those skills are now catalogued in §6.13–§6.24 above (plus the security skills introduced by PR #151 in §6.25–§6.28) and the lint runs hard-fail across the whole plugin.

The lint rules in §5 fire at `error` severity for **every** SKILL.md under `plugins/power-pages/skills/`. There is no skill-class carve-out. When you add a new skill:

1. Catalog every `AskUserQuestion` call in §6 — pick category from §3, pick `cancel-leaves` from §4.3.
2. Add `<!-- gate: ... -->` markers in the SKILL.md per §4.
3. Mark every data-gathering prompt with `<!-- not-a-gate: ... -->`.
4. Run `node scripts/lint-skills-alm.js`. CI will block the PR otherwise.

## 9. Decisions — pre-resolved with recommendations

These need explicit confirmation from the reviewer before SKILL.md edits land. Recommendation in **bold**.

| # | Decision | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Canonical term | **"Approval Gate"** | CI/CD heritage; already the most common word in our SKILL.md files; concrete. Drop "review gate" if used informally. |
| 2 | Marker syntax | **HTML comment `<!-- gate: ID \| category=X \| cancel-leaves=Y -->` + human `> 🚦 Gate (...)` block** | Comment is the lint anchor; block is for humans. Robust to interleaved prose. |
| 3 | Catalog location | **`plugins/power-pages/references/approval-gates.md`** (this file) + a one-line pointer in `PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` | Sits with other shared references; cross-skill scope is obvious from the path. |
| 4 | Lint rollout strictness | **[v2 — superseded by §10.] ALM: hard-fail. Non-ALM: warn-only until §8 catalog extends.** v3 made enforcement hard-fail across every skill once the catalog was extended; the warn-only branch is gone. | ALM is fully catalogued; non-ALM is the follow-up. Hard-fail on ALM forces drift to be caught at PR time. |
| 5 | Emoji vs plain text | **Keep `🚦` in the human block; lint anchors on the HTML comment regardless** | Emoji is for humans; tooling doesn't depend on it. |
| 6 | Wildcard gate IDs (e.g. `diagnose-deployment:6.*`) | **Disallowed. Enumerate per pattern.** | Per-pattern markers enforce that each catalog-listed deployment-error pattern has matching prompt logic. |

## 10. Landing history

**v2 PR (landed)** — `approval-gates.md` v2 doc; `<!-- gate: ID -->` markers added to the 12 ALM SKILL.md files; 5 GATE lint rules added to `scripts/lint-skills-alm.js` at hard-fail for ALM, warn-only for non-ALM.

**v3 PR (this branch — `users/nityagi/ApplyApprovalGatesPattern`)** — extends the catalog and enforcement to the 12 non-ALM skills plus the 4 security skills picked up in the rebase:

- §6.13–§6.24 added — full catalog rows for `create-site`, `deploy-site`, `add-server-logic`, `add-cloud-flow`, `setup-auth`, `integrate-webapi`, `setup-datamodel`, `add-sample-data`, `add-seo`, `create-webroles`, `audit-permissions`, `integrate-backend` (45 gates + 9 not-a-gates).
- §6.24a–§6.28 added — security skills introduced by PR #151 (`manage-firewall`, `manage-headers`, `scan-site`, `security-review`). The new skills use a runtime-loop prompt pattern; §6.24a documents the marker convention for that pattern. 3 gates + 2 not-a-gates.
- §6.30 added — `scan-code` (Power Pages source & dependency security scan). 3 `plan` gates (`scan-code:1.agent-review-fallback`, `scan-code:2.scope-choice`, `scan-code:2.depth-choice`); no not-a-gates.
- Markers added to all non-ALM SKILL.md files (HTML comment + 🚦 block per gate; `not-a-gate` comment per data-gathering prompt or meta-mention).
- `scripts/lint-skills-alm.js` warn-only branch removed — all skills now hard-fail.
- `AGENTS.md` Key Patterns updated — Approval Gate convention applies plugin-wide; new skills must extend §6 in the same PR they introduce a prompt.
- `report-issue` excluded from the catalog because its `AskUserQuestion` calls come from a cross-plugin shared workflow. **Cross-plugin TODO:** those shared prompts are not caught by any per-plugin lint today. A future cross-plugin sweep should define a `shared:*` namespace in the catalog or explicitly opt each plugin copy into per-plugin lint coverage.
- v3 lint changes: removed warn-only branch; tightened `m <= promptLine` to strict `m <`; relaxed `CATALOG_GATE_ID_PATTERN` to case-insensitive on the skill-name segment; added two new rules — `CATALOG-row-must-have-marker` (reverse check — catalog rows of `kind: gate` must have a matching SKILL.md marker; prevents the orphan-row class of bug v3 closed by hand) and `GATE-prose-block-required` (every marker must be followed within 10 lines by a 🚦 sentinel; minimum-viable check against prose-block deletion). Field rename: `Blast radius if skipped:` → `Why we ask:` across all ~60 prose blocks plus §4.1 template.

## 11. Open questions remaining

These are honest unresolved questions — not necessary to answer before v2 lands, but flagged for future tightening:

- **Does `intent` need a sub-category for plan-alm itself?** plan-alm is the front-door planner; it doesn't have a Phase 0 ALM-plan gate (because it *is* the plan). The closest analogue is `plan-alm:1.deferral` (handle `.alm-deferred` marker) and `plan-alm:1.completeness` (completeness check). Both are tagged `progress` in §6.1 — defensible but worth a second look.
- **Should `pause` gates be allowed to auto-resume?** Currently the lint rule would flag any tooling that auto-responds. But if PP Pipelines exposes a polling endpoint that detects approval state, a deterministic auto-resume becomes possible. Worth a future rule extension.
- **Telemetry on gate cancellation.** A gate that's cancelled 80% of the time is asking the wrong question. Out of scope for v2; worth instrumenting once §5 lint lands.
- **Multi-prompt gates.** Some entries in §6 cover multiple `AskUserQuestion` calls under one marker (e.g., `setup-solution:5.5*` is one logical gate but renders three multiSelect prompts). The lint rule says one marker can cover multiple calls if the catalog row documents it. Worth a more precise rule once we see drift.
- **Phase-number drift is silent.** Catalog rows reference SKILL.md phase numbers as plain strings (`7.6.4`, `3 (Q3 PP)`, `2.1.2`). If a skill is refactored to renumber phases (e.g. `7.6.4` → `7.7.1`), the catalog row's "Phase" column desyncs with no signal. **Convention:** any SKILL.md phase renumber MUST grep this catalog for the old phase number and update the row(s). Worth a future lint rule that asserts each catalog phase-reference is findable as a heading in the owning SKILL.md.
- **Runtime-loop coverage — historical.** Earlier v3 drafts treated the manage-firewall + scan-site destructive prompts as a known coverage gap because they sat inside a "recommend then ask" loop with no statically-locatable `AskUserQuestion`:` call site, and only the `### Option rules` sections carried `not-a-gate` markers. v3 closed the gap (see §6.24a) by restructuring the prose to surface real call sites and adding `manage-firewall:3.action-choice`, `manage-firewall:3.execute-consent`, and `scan-site:3.action-choice` as full gate markers. The `not-a-gate` markers on the `### Option rules` sections are retained for the meta-documentation sections only.
- **Lint enforces only the 🚦 sentinel, not the 3 structured labels.** `GATE-prose-block-required` checks for 🚦 within 10 lines of a marker. It does NOT verify the recommended `> **Trigger:**` / `> **Why we ask:**` / `> **Cancel leaves:**` labels — 80+ legacy v2 markers use a one-line prose style. Drift on the labels remains possible. Tightening the rule to require the 3 labels would force a structural rewrite of every legacy marker — explicit deferral.
