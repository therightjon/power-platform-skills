  Ensures the tenant has a usable Power Platform Pipelines host environment
  before any pipeline operation runs. Detects host state via the same
  resolution order as the Power Apps UI (org-db setting → BAP env metadata →
  default-custom-host setting); if any existing host (Platform or Custom) is
  found, uses it. If no host is bound to the source env, provisions a new
  **Platform Host** (recommended, idempotent) or a **Custom Host** via the
  BAP env-create API with the `D365_ProjectHost` template, or guides the user
  through PPAC install / `New custom host` (manual fallbacks). Polls
  lifecycle operations, verifies the host responds to Pipelines API calls,
  writes a host-check artifact other ALM skills consume. Use when asked to:
  "set up pipelines host", "ensure pipelines host", "no pipelines host",
  "install pipelines", "create pipelines host", "provision platform host",
  "provision custom host". Also invoked transparently by
  /power-pages:setup-pipeline when its host discovery step finds nothing.

# ensure-pipelines-host

> **Scope:** When no host is bound to the source env, this skill detects any existing host (Custom or PE) for reuse, or — in `NoHost` state — offers three provisioning paths: a new **Platform Host** (recommended; idempotent, ~3–5 min); a new **Custom Host** (admin-only, ~5–10 min); or PPAC manual provisioning (fallback). Implementation details — endpoint names, template names, BAP audience — live in Phase 4.0 / 4.A / 4.C below; user-facing prose stays focused on outcomes.

Power Platform Pipelines need a **host environment** — a Dataverse environment with the *Power Platform Pipelines* managed solution installed, where pipelines, stages, run history, and artifacts live. The existing `setup-pipeline` and `deploy-pipeline` skills assume a host is already configured. This skill closes that gap.

## What we know (sources of truth)

This plan is grounded in three primary sources, in priority order:

1. **`useGetOrCreatePlatformEnvironment.v4.ts`** (Microsoft-internal client source — `power-platform-ux/packages/powerapps-appdeployment-ux/src/hooks/v4/`). Defines the exact HTTP contract for Platform Environment provisioning: endpoint, body, headers, polling.
2. **`ProjectHostProvider.tsx`** (same repo, `src/components/ProjectHostProvider/`). Defines the exact resolution order the Power Apps UI uses to determine which environment is the project host for a source environment. We mirror that order so this skill agrees with the UI.
3. **eng.ms `createcustompipelineshost`** (Microsoft-internal). Documents the Custom Host fast-path: a `D365_ProjectHost` org template that ships the Pipelines app pre-installed, callable through the standard environment-creation API.

Public Microsoft Learn (`learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/alm/{platform-host-pipelines, custom-host-pipelines, set-a-default-pipelines-host}`) is the user-facing description of the same flows; we cite it for behaviors users will recognize. HARs in `PipelinesDeployScenario.har` and `Pipelines.har` confirm the read-side calls.

## Three host shapes the tenant can be in

| Shape | How it got there | Where it lives | Org template |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Platform Host (PE)** | Auto-provisioned by `getOrCreate` BAP call (or as a side-effect of first navigation to the Pipelines page in `make.powerapps.com`). Hidden from the env picker. One per tenant. | Microsoft-managed Dataverse env in tenant's home geo | `D365_1stPartyAdminApps` |
| **Custom Host** | Created by an admin via PPAC `Deployments → New custom host`, or via the standard env-create API with the `D365_ProjectHost` template, or by installing the Power Platform Pipelines app on an existing Dataverse env. | A regular Dataverse env in the tenant | `D365_ProjectHost` (or app-installed-onto-existing-env) |
| **No host bound to source env** | Tenant has not used Pipelines from this env. | — | — |

The current `discover-pipelines-host.js` only checks the tenant-level `DefaultCustomPipelinesHostEnvForTenant` setting. That's one signal of many. This skill implements the full resolution order.

## Resolution order (mirrors `ProjectHostProvider.tsx`)

This is the load-bearing decision tree. It is what the Power Apps UI does. We replicate it so the skill agrees with the UI.

Source: `ProjectHostProvider.tsx` lines 100–213 (orgSetting fetch → defaultCustomPipelinesHost fetch → finalProjectHostEnvironmentId resolution).

## What this skill does NOT do

These are deliberate non-goals (each based on a hard constraint or a destructive blast-radius — see *Design Constraints* below):

- **Does not silently provision anything.** Any action that creates an env or binds the source env to a host requires explicit user confirmation, with the tenant name + tenant ID echoed back. PE is tenant-singleton and admin-non-deletable, so the Phase 4.0 pre-call confirmation gate is the principal mitigation against wrong-tenant provisioning. The `getOrCreate` endpoint is idempotent — calling it on a tenant that already has a PE returns the existing one rather than creating a duplicate.
- **Does not call `Force Link`** to rebind an environment to a different host. Force Link is destructive (makers lose access to existing pipelines in the previous host) and is hidden behind a separate confirmation gate, only reachable when the user explicitly says "rebind".
- **Does not change the tenant-level `DefaultCustomPipelinesHostEnvForTenant` setting.** That setting is irreversible-adjacent (existing pipelines in the previous default become inaccessible — see `learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/alm/set-a-default-pipelines-host`). Out of scope.
- **Does not delete environments.**
- **Does not write `ProjectHostEnvironmentId` directly.** Binding is established through the documented Pipelines flow (creating a `deploymentenvironment` record in the host); writing the org setting directly bypasses validation.

## Auth strategy: PAC-first with BAP fallback (`--source auto`)

Read-side detection (Phase 2 resolution order, env list, env-by-id) defaults to `--source auto`:
1. If a BAP token is provided, **try BAP env-list / env-GET first** (richer data including `lastModifiedTime`, `permissions`, `tenantId`).
2. **On HTTP 401 or 403, fall back to `pac admin list --json`** via `pac-bap-shim.js`. PAC has its own first-party client-ID grants on BAP that Az CLI doesn't always inherit (verified 2026-04-28: `D365DemoTSCE53051106` demo tenant rejects Az tokens for BAP even with correct audience claims).
3. If no BAP token is provided at all, go straight to PAC.

The PAC shim returns BAP-shaped data; downstream code (sku filter, ranking, classification) is unchanged. Fields not provided by PAC (`tenantId`, `lastModifiedTime`, `permissions`, `isManaged`) come back as `null` — none are critical for host detection. PAC also doesn't surface Platform Hosts (PE) since `pac admin list` doesn't include Platform-sku envs; PE detection requires `--source bap` with a working BAP token.

**Write-side actions** (env-create POST in `provision-custom-host.js`, lifecycle op polling) still require BAP. Az CLI tokens with the right audience usually work for these even when env-list calls fail, because the BAP RP enforces different policy on actions than reads. If `provision-custom-host.js` returns 401, the user must register a service principal in the target tenant (or use the PPAC UI fallback path 4.C).

## Design Constraints

1. **JIT provisioning is required when a PE is selected — existing or freshly provisioned.** From `ProjectHostProvider.tsx` (line 232–240 comment): *"In the Platform Environment case, the user may not already be provisioned there, so BAP cannot discover it. So we'll use the org URL we retrieve from the getOrCreate call to make this first request so that user JIT can be triggered."* When Phase 2 detects an existing PE and the user accepts it (Phase 3.A) — or when Phase 4.0 provisions a new PE via `getOrCreate` — Phase 5's `WhoAmI` call against `instanceApiUrl` triggers JIT before any subsequent host op. (For Custom Host paths the caller has access by construction.)
2. **`CannotRedirect` is a real terminal state**, not a theoretical edge case. It happens when `ProjectHostEnvironmentId` (org setting on source env) points at PE but `DefaultCustomPipelinesHostEnvForTenant` (admin tenant setting) points elsewhere. The skill must detect this and surface it as a specific error — falling through silently would route pipeline ops at the wrong host.
3. **Admin-only Custom Host fast-path.** PPAC's `New custom host` flow is gated by `DeploymentHubCreatePipelinesHostForAdminsOnly` and shows only for Global / Power Platform / Dynamics admins (eng.ms doc). The BAP env-create API also needs the equivalent privilege. Non-admins get 403; the skill preflight-attestation-prompts and gracefully falls back to manual paths.
4. **404 from BAP env GET is ambiguous.** Returns 404 for *deleted*, *disabled*, *no-PE*, and *no-access* without distinguishing (`PowerPipelines_PE_Knowledge.md` §6.A). We never treat a single 404 as "no host exists" — we corroborate via list-environments and the org setting before acting.
5. **Each environment is bound to only one host at a time.** Rebinding requires Force Link, which is destructive in the previous host. Out of scope (see non-goals).
6. **The skill runs in user OAuth context** — same scope and audience the Power Apps UI uses. BAP calls use `https://service.powerapps.com/` audience.

> **Idempotency of `getOrCreate`** — the BAP `getOrCreate` endpoint is idempotent (existing PE returns 200 + `provisioningState === 'Succeeded'`; new PE returns 202 + lifecycle op). Phase 4.0 leverages this — calling getOrCreate on a tenant that already has a PE is safe and just returns the existing one. The `provision-platform-host.js` helper surfaces the distinction via an `alreadyExisted: true | false` flag in its return value (recorded in the `docs/alm/last-host-check.json` telemetry block as `platformHostAlreadyExisted`).

## Prerequisites

- PAC CLI logged in (`pac env who` succeeds)
- Azure CLI logged in (`az account show` succeeds)
- A source Dataverse environment URL (read from `powerpages.config.json` if invoked from a Power Pages project; passed as arg otherwise)
- For Phase 4 admin-only paths: caller has Global / Power Platform / Dynamics admin (skill detects and surfaces 403 cleanly if missing)

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Detect prerequisites and gather tenant context

**Create all tasks upfront at the start of this phase.**

Tasks to create:

1. "Check local cache and detect prerequisites"
2. "Run resolution order to find host"
3. "Confirm action with user"
4. "Execute chosen path"
5. "JIT-provision and verify host"
6. "Write host-check artifact"

Steps:

0. **Local cache fast-path.** If `docs/alm/last-host-check.json` exists AND `Date.now() - Date.parse(checkedAt) < cacheMaxAgeMs` (default 24h; configurable via `--cacheMaxAgeHours`):
   - Acquire `HOST_TOKEN` for the cached `finalHostEnvUrl` origin.
   - One cheap probe: `GET {finalHostEnvUrl}/api/data/v9.0/solutions?$filter=uniquename eq 'msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor'&$select=version&$top=1` (proves Pipelines is installed AND captures version in one round-trip)
     - 200 → cache is valid. Set `RESOLUTION` from the cached file. Set `ACTION_TAKEN = "none"`. Skip Phases 2–5; jump to Phase 6 with a "reused cached host" summary.
     - 404 / 403 / timeout / network → cache is stale or no longer accessible. Continue to Step 1 (full resolution). Do NOT fail — stale cache is expected after env deletion or permission changes.
   - If the file is missing, malformed, older than `cacheMaxAgeMs`, or contains `ready: false` → continue to Step 1.
   - **Skip this step entirely** if `--no-cache` is passed (used in CI / smoke tests).

1. Run `verify-alm-prerequisites.js`:
   ```bash
   node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/verify-alm-prerequisites.js"
   ```
   Capture `.envUrl` (`devEnvUrl`), `.token` (`DEV_TOKEN`), `.userId`, `.tenantId`, `.organizationId`. Stop on auth failure with the script's remediation message.

2. Run `detect-project-context.js` (non-fatal — skill is also valid outside a Power Pages project):
   ```bash
   node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/detect-project-context.js"
   ```
   Capture `.siteName` and `.solutionManifest` for messaging.

3. Acquire BAP token (different audience than Dataverse):
   ```bash
   az account get-access-token --resource "https://service.powerapps.com/" --query accessToken -o tsv
   ```
   Store as `BAP_TOKEN`. This is used by all BAP `/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/...` calls in Phases 2 and 4.

3a. **Resolve tenant display name** (one-shot, best-effort). Phase 1.4 and Phase 4.0 echo a human-readable tenant name alongside the tenant GUID so the user can verify the target tenant. Acquire it from the Microsoft Graph organization endpoint:

   ```bash
   az rest --method GET --url "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/organization?$select=id,displayName" --resource "https://graph.microsoft.com/" --query "value[0].displayName" -o tsv
   ```

   Store as `TENANT_DISPLAY_NAME`. On any failure (no Graph permission, network error, multi-tenant ambiguity), fall back to `TENANT_DISPLAY_NAME = null` and continue — Phase 1.4 / 4.0 prompts handle a null display name by showing the tenant GUID alone.

<!-- gate: ensure-pipelines-host:1.4.tenant-identity | category=consent | cancel-leaves=nothing -->
> 🚦 **Gate (consent · ensure-pipelines-host:1.4.tenant-identity):** Echo tenant display name + tenant GUID + dev env URL before any host detection. First of the wrong-tenant guards. Cancel exits cleanly before any BAP/Dataverse call.

4. **Tenant identity confirmation gate.** Echo back via `AskUserQuestion`:

   > "About to inspect Pipelines host configuration for tenant **{TENANT_DISPLAY_NAME}** (`{tenantId}`), org `{organizationId}`, dev env `{devEnvUrl}`. Continue? 1. Yes / 2. Cancel"

   (When `TENANT_DISPLAY_NAME` is null, drop the bold tenant-name segment and lead with the tenant GUID.)

   First of the consent gates that guard against wrong-tenant operations.

### Phase 1.5 — Ground in current Pipelines host documentation

> Reference: `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/alm-docs-grounding.md`

Cap this step at ~30 seconds. If MCP search / fetch errors out, log a one-line note and continue — this skill must remain runnable offline.

1. Run `microsoft_docs_search` with the query: `Power Platform Pipelines host environment Platform Host Custom Host`.
2. Fetch `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/pipelines` (and at most one sister page on host setup, default-custom-host configuration, or admin role requirements) in parallel via `microsoft_docs_fetch`.
3. Extract a one-paragraph summary of what Microsoft Learn currently says about Platform vs Custom Host trade-offs, the resolution order (org-db setting → BAP env metadata → tenant default), and admin role requirements. Compare against this skill's own *Resolution order* section and `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/cicd-pipeline-patterns.md`; flag any divergence (e.g. new Platform-Host SKU, changed default-custom-host setting name, new tenant policy controls).
4. Use the summary to inform Phase 2+ decisions. Do not silently change skill behavior — surface any divergence to the user as a soft warning before Phase 3 (Confirm action with user).

### Phase 2 — Run resolution order to find host

This phase is read-only. It produces a `RESOLUTION` object the user-confirm phase branches on.

The phase mirrors `ProjectHostProvider.tsx` exactly. The `useState` variables in that hook map to fields in our `RESOLUTION`:

| TS variable | Our field |
|---|---|
| `orgSetting.orgDbOrgSettingValue` | `orgSettingHostEnvId` |
| `initialProjectHostEnvironmentId` | (same) |
| `isInitialHostPlatformEnvironment` | `isPlatform` |
| `defaultCustomPipelinesHost` | `tenantDefaultCustomHostEnvId` |
| `finalProjectHostEnvironmentId` | `finalHostEnvId` |
| `projectHostStatus` | `status` |

Steps:

1. **Org-setting probe** (mirrors `useGetOrgDbOrgSetting('ProjectHostEnvironmentId')` line 103 in tsx). New helper `check-env-host-binding.js`:

   ```
   POST {devEnvUrl}/api/data/v9.0/GetOrgDbOrgSetting
   Authorization: Bearer {DEV_TOKEN}
   Body: { "SettingName": "ProjectHostEnvironmentId" }
   ```
   - Empty `SettingValue` → no current binding. Skip to Step 4.
   - Non-empty → store as `orgSettingHostEnvId`. Continue to Step 2.

2. **Resolve env via BAP** (mirrors `useGetEnvironmentByName(initialProjectHostEnvironmentId)` line 483 in tsx). New helper `resolve-env-by-id.js`:

   ```
   GET https://api.bap.microsoft.com/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/environments/{envId}?api-version=2020-06-01&$expand=properties.linkedEnvironmentMetadata,properties.permissions
   Authorization: Bearer {BAP_TOKEN}
   ```
   - 200 → capture `environmentSku`, `displayName`, `linkedEnvironmentMetadata.instanceApiUrl`, `linkedEnvironmentMetadata.instanceUrl`. Set `RESOLUTION.isPlatform = (environmentSku === 'Platform')`.
   - 404 → **disambiguate before acting** (Constraint 5). Run `list-tenant-envs.js` (Step 5) and check whether the env is in the list:
     - If listed → user lacks access → set `RESOLUTION.status = "PermissionDenied"`, surface to user, stop.
     - If not listed → env is genuinely deleted/disabled → set `RESOLUTION.status = "OrgSettingStale"`, recommend the user clear `ProjectHostEnvironmentId` and re-run, stop.
   - 403 → set `RESOLUTION.status = "PermissionDenied"`, stop.

3. **If `isPlatform === true`**, mirror the default-custom-tenant-setting check (lines 148–213 in tsx). Reuse the existing `discover-pipelines-host.js`:

   ```bash
   node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/discover-pipelines-host.js" \
     --envUrl "{devEnvUrl}" --token "{DEV_TOKEN}" --userId "{userId}"
   ```
   - `found: false` → tenant has no admin default custom host. `finalHostEnvId = orgSettingHostEnvId` (the PE). Set `RESOLUTION.status = "AvailableUsingPlatformHost"`.
   - `found: true` AND `hostEnvUrl` matches `orgSettingHostEnvId` → admin-default agrees with org setting. `finalHostEnvId = orgSettingHostEnvId`. Set `RESOLUTION.status = "AvailableUsingCustomHostByAdminDefault"`.
   - `found: true` AND `hostEnvUrl` does NOT match `orgSettingHostEnvId` → **`CannotRedirect`** (Constraint 3). Set `RESOLUTION.status = "CannotRedirect"`, capture both URLs. Stop with the specific error message — only an admin can resolve this.

   **If `isPlatform === false`** (Custom Host): use directly. `finalHostEnvId = orgSettingHostEnvId`. Set `RESOLUTION.status = "AvailableUsingCustomHost"`. Skip Step 4–5; jump to Step 6.

4. **No org setting → tenant-wide search before declaring NoHost.** Source env isn't bound, but a usable Custom Host may already exist in the tenant (admin-created, or created by a prior run of this skill in another project). Always inventory before offering to create.

5. **Tenant env inventory + Pipelines-presence probe** (decisional — feeds `RESOLUTION.status`). New helper `list-tenant-envs.js`:

   **Step 5a — list envs:**
   ```
   GET https://api.bap.microsoft.com/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/environments?api-version=2020-06-01&$expand=properties.linkedEnvironmentMetadata
   Authorization: Bearer {BAP_TOKEN}
   ```
   For each env capture `{ envId, displayName, environmentSku, instanceApiUrl, isManaged, hasDataverse: !!instanceApiUrl }`.

   **Step 5b — Pipelines-presence probe per env** (parallel, max 10 concurrent; bounded by sku filter + maxEnvsToProbe cap):

   **Pre-filter** (avoid probing every env in large tenants — recon found tenants with 1000+ envs):
   - Skip envs without Dataverse (`linkedEnvironmentMetadata.instanceApiUrl == null`).
   - Skip envs not in `--skus` (default: `Production,Sandbox` — both are valid hosts for the Pipelines app via Phase 4.B install-on-existing). PE always reports `environmentSku === 'Platform'` and is included regardless. Pass `--skus Production,Sandbox,Trial` to include Trial envs (eligible for app-install via 4.B but **not** for env-create via 4.A — Trial-license tenants get `NotEnoughCapacity_HasTrialLicense` from env-create).
   - Sort remaining by `lastModifiedTime` desc.
   - Cap at `--maxEnvsToProbe` (default 50; covers the typical-tenant 80% case in <5s with 10-concurrent).
   - If cap is reached and no host found, surface a warning: `"Scanned N of M envs (filter: Production+Sandbox, sorted by lastModifiedTime). Pass --maxEnvsToProbe N+ or --skus Production,Sandbox,Trial to widen."`

   **Probe query** (single query covers presence-check AND version-capture):
   ```
   GET {instanceApiUrl}/api/data/v9.0/solutions?$filter=uniquename eq 'msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor'&$select=uniquename,version&$top=1
   Authorization: Bearer {HOST_TOKEN-per-env}
   OData-Version: 4.0
   OData-MaxVersion: 4.0
   ```
   - 200 with `value.length === 1` → Pipelines installed. Capture `value[0].version` as `pipelinesSolutionVersion`. **Mark as Custom Host candidate** (or PE if `environmentSku === 'Platform'`).
   - 200 with `value.length === 0` → no Pipelines. If Dataverse + caller has access, mark `eligible-for-app-install`.
   - 404 → entity exists but Dataverse unreachable / wrong URL; treat as not-a-candidate.
   - 403 → caller cannot access; do NOT count as a host candidate. Add to `inaccessibleEnvs[]` for warnings only.
   - timeout / 5xx → log to warnings, treat as not-a-candidate; do not retry.

   > **Why not `deploymentpipelines?$top=0`?** Dataverse rejects `$top=0` on `deploymentpipelines` with HTTP 400 "Invalid value for $top query option" even on a properly installed host (verified against `pascalepipelineshost.crm.dynamics.com` 2026-04-28). The `solutions?$filter=uniquename eq 'msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor'` query is the correct cheap probe — single round-trip, no rate-limit concerns at $top=1, and it returns the version we need anyway.

   **Token strategy for 5b**: acquire one HOST_TOKEN per distinct env origin via `az account get-access-token --resource "{origin}"`, cached in-memory for the run. Token acquisition itself shouldn't fail unless the resource doesn't exist (deleted env), in which case skip.

   **Output of step 5** (`RESOLUTION.candidates`):
   ```js
   {
     existingCustomHosts: [{ envId, instanceApiUrl, displayName, environmentSku, pipelinesSolutionVersion }, ...],
     existingPlatformHost: { envId, instanceApiUrl, displayName, ... } | null,  // at most one
     eligibleForAppInstall: [{ envId, instanceApiUrl, displayName }, ...],
     inaccessibleEnvs: [{ envId, displayName, reason: "403" | "timeout" }, ...]
   }
   ```

   **Decision logic** (sets `RESOLUTION.status`):
   - `existingCustomHosts.length === 1` → `RESOLUTION.status = "AvailableUnboundCustomHost"`. Set `finalHostEnvId / finalHostEnvUrl` provisionally to that host (Phase 3.C-pre will confirm).
   - `existingCustomHosts.length > 1` → `RESOLUTION.status = "MultipleUnboundCustomHosts"`. Phase 3.C-pre' will ask user to pick.
   - `existingCustomHosts.length === 0` AND `existingPlatformHost !== null` → `RESOLUTION.status = "PlatformHostExistsUnbound"`. Phase 3.C-pre'' offers PE-use (no creation needed; a PE already lives in the tenant). Note: actual binding of source env to PE happens through the documented Pipelines flow when `setup-pipeline` registers source env in `deploymentenvironments`, same as Custom Host.
   - All zero → `RESOLUTION.status = "NoHost"`. Phase 3.C decision tree (create-new).

   > **Self-detection note:** Custom Hosts created by previous runs of this skill (Phase 4.A `D365_ProjectHost` template) install the Pipelines solution as part of the template. They surface in `existingCustomHosts` on the *exact same signal* as admin-created hosts. We do not need a marker on hosts we created ourselves — the Pipelines-solution-installed signal is sufficient.

6. **Pipelines solution version probe** (only when `finalHostEnvId` is known and not already populated by step 5b). On the resolved host instanceUrl:

   ```
   GET {hostEnvUrl}/api/data/v9.0/solutions?$filter=uniquename eq '{PIPELINES_SOLUTION_UNIQUE_NAME}'&$select=version,installedon
   Authorization: Bearer {HOST_TOKEN}
   ```

   Where `HOST_TOKEN` is acquired against `{hostEnvUrl origin}` via `az account get-access-token --resource`.

   The solution's exact unique name is an open item — see *Open Items*. Working hypothesis: `msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor`. Capture `PIPELINES_SOLUTION_VERSION`. If query returns empty (solution missing on a non-PE host) → `RESOLUTION.status = "HostWithoutPipelines"` — Phase 3.D path.

Report findings to user:

> "Tenant `{tenantId}` host status: **{RESOLUTION.status}**. {Status-specific summary line.}"

### Phase 3 — Confirm action with user

Branches by `RESOLUTION.status`. Each branch ends with either *"proceed to Phase 5"* (host already usable) or *"Phase 4 with chosen path"*.

#### 3.A — Status `AvailableUsingCustomHost` / `AvailableUsingCustomHostByAdminDefault` / `AvailableUsingPlatformHost`

Host is established. Confirm and skip ahead.

> "Found existing host: `{finalHostEnvUrl}` (`{RESOLUTION.status}`, Pipelines solution v`{PIPELINES_SOLUTION_VERSION}`). Use this host?
> 1. Yes — proceed to verification
> 2. Cancel"

- Yes → set `ACTION_TAKEN = "none"`, jump to Phase 5.
- Cancel → exit.

#### 3.B — Status `CannotRedirect`

Locked state. Cannot proceed.

> "Cannot proceed: `ProjectHostEnvironmentId` on `{devEnvUrl}` points at the Platform Host (`{orgSettingHostEnvId}`), but the tenant admin set `DefaultCustomPipelinesHostEnvForTenant` to a different env (`{tenantDefaultCustomHostEnvId}`). The Pipelines UI cannot redirect this env to the admin's choice. Resolution requires a Power Platform admin to either (a) clear the tenant default, or (b) update the org setting on this env. Exiting."

Stop.

#### 3.C-pre — Status `AvailableUnboundCustomHost` (single existing Custom Host found)

Tenant already has exactly one Custom Host with Pipelines installed. Source env isn't bound to it yet, but binding happens automatically when `setup-pipeline` registers the source env in the host's `deploymentenvironments` table. **Reusing avoids creating duplicate hosts.**

> "Found an existing Custom Host in tenant `{tenantId}`:
> - **Display name:** `{displayName}`
> - **URL:** `{instanceApiUrl}`
> - **Pipelines solution:** v`{pipelinesSolutionVersion}`
>
> Source env `{devEnvUrl}` is not yet bound to it — that will happen automatically the first time `setup-pipeline` runs against this host. Use this host?
> 1. Yes — use existing host (recommended; avoids duplicates)
> 2. No — show me the create-new decision tree (Phase 3.C)
> 3. Cancel"

- Yes → set `finalHostEnvUrl/Id`, `ACTION_TAKEN = "reuse-existing-custom"`, jump to Phase 5.
- No → fall through to Phase 3.C `NoHost` decision tree (still allows creating another).
- Cancel → exit.

#### 3.C-pre' — Status `MultipleUnboundCustomHosts` (multiple existing Custom Hosts found)

> "Found {N} existing Custom Hosts in tenant `{tenantId}` with Pipelines installed. Pick one to use, or create new:
>
> 1. `{host[0].displayName}` (`{host[0].instanceApiUrl}`, Pipelines v`{host[0].pipelinesSolutionVersion}`)
> 2. `{host[1].displayName}` (...)
> ...
> N. ...
> N+1. **Create new Custom Host instead** — go to Phase 3.C decision tree
> N+2. Cancel"

- Selection 1..N → set `finalHostEnvUrl/Id` from picked host, `ACTION_TAKEN = "reuse-existing-custom"`, jump to Phase 5.
- N+1 → fall through to Phase 3.C `NoHost` decision tree.
- N+2 → exit.

#### 3.C-pre'' — Status `PlatformHostExistsUnbound` (PE already exists, no Custom Host)

A PE already exists in the tenant (one is provisioned automatically the first time anyone navigated to the Pipelines page). Per scope decision, this iteration does NOT auto-provision a PE, but if one already exists, we offer to use it.

> "Tenant `{tenantId}` already has a Platform Host (`{instanceApiUrl}`, Pipelines v`{pipelinesSolutionVersion}`). Source env is not yet bound to it. Use this host?
> 1. Yes — use existing Platform Host (idempotent — already provisioned in this tenant)
> 2. No — create a Custom Host instead (Phase 3.C decision tree)
> 3. Cancel"

- Yes → set `finalHostEnvUrl/Id` from PE, `ACTION_TAKEN = "reuse-existing-pe"`, jump to Phase 5. (Phase 5's WhoAmI call triggers JIT — Constraint 1.)
- No → fall through to Phase 3.C `NoHost` decision tree (admin-created Custom Host preferred for governance).
- Cancel → exit.

#### 3.C — Status `NoHost` (host-type decision tree)

<!-- gate: ensure-pipelines-host:3.C.host-type | category=plan | cancel-leaves=nothing -->

> 🚦 **Gate (plan · ensure-pipelines-host:3.C.host-type):** Top-level host-type prompt — pick Platform Host / Custom Host / PPAC manual / Manual export-import strategy / Cancel. Drives the rest of Phase 3 and Phase 4 routing.

<!-- gate: ensure-pipelines-host:3.C.env-pick | category=plan | cancel-leaves=nothing -->

> 🚦 **Gate (plan · ensure-pipelines-host:3.C.env-pick):** Sub-prompt under 3.C top-level option "Custom Host" — present the eligible-env list (capped at 5) with role labels (`dev env`, `source env`, `staging env`, `production env`) and the "Other (paste URL)" fallback. Fires only on the Custom-Host branch of the host-type menu.
>
> **Trigger:** User picked "Custom Host" in 3.C top-level.
> **Why we ask:** Auto-picking the wrong env routes pipelines through a host the user didn't intend.
> **Cancel leaves:** Nothing — no app install fired.

The prompt asks the user to pick the **host type** first (Platform Host, Custom Host, PPAC manual, or cancel). Picking Custom Host opens a sub-prompt for the install method (existing env vs. create-new). The Platform-Host path is the lowest-friction default and is presented first.

**Skip rule — caller already collected the answer.** When this skill is invoked from `setup-pipeline` and `docs/alm/last-pipeline.json` carries a `hostResolution` block populated by plan-alm Phase 2 Q4, inspect those flags before showing the prompt:

| Upstream signal | Action |
|---|---|
| `hostResolution.willProvisionPlatform === true` | Skip Phase 3.C entirely. Route directly to **Phase 4.0** (provision new Platform Host). The pre-call confirmation gate in 4.0 still runs — see 4.0 "Pre-call confirmation (NON-SKIPPABLE)" below. |
| `hostResolution.chosenEnvUrl` is a non-empty URL | Skip Phase 3.C entirely. Set `CHOSEN_ENV_URL = hostResolution.chosenEnvUrl`, route directly to **Phase 4.B** with that env (4.B step 1's "already chosen" path applies). Set `ACTION_TAKEN` per the existing routing table (`"user-installed-app-on-dev"` when origin matches `devEnvUrl`, else `"user-installed-app"`). |
| `hostResolution.willProvisionCustom === true` AND `chosenEnvUrl` empty | Skip Phase 3.C. Route directly to **Phase 4.A** (provision new Custom Host). The pre-call confirmation gate in 4.A still runs. |
| `hostResolution.willUsePpac === true` AND `chosenEnvUrl` empty | Skip Phase 3.C. Route directly to **Phase 4.C** (PPAC manual). |
| None of the above | Run Phase 3.C as written below. |

**Why this skip rule exists.** plan-alm Phase 2 Q4 NoHost branch presents the same host-type menu so the user makes the choice once, at planning time, with the rendered ALM plan in front of them. Re-prompting in 3.C at execution time would force a second answer to the same question and risks the agent treating one of the answers as authoritative and ignoring the other (the bug behind the trial-license-409 → wrong-env-fallback chain that surfaced on 2026-05-05). Whenever the upstream signal is present, trust it.

**Step 1: present the top-level host-type prompt.**

> "No Pipelines host bound to `{devEnvUrl}`. Which environment should host Pipelines?
>
> Pipelines lives in one env per tenant; pipelines, stages, and run history are stored there. Source envs deploy through it.
>
> 1. **Provision a Platform Host (recommended)** — Microsoft-managed Dataverse env auto-provisioned in your tenant home geo. Pipelines app pre-installed. Idempotent (safe to re-run). ~3–5 min.
>
> 2. **Set up a Custom Host** — Pipelines lives in a Dataverse env you control. We'll ask whether to use an existing env or create a brand-new dedicated one.
>
> 3. **Open PPAC and create one manually** — fallback if option 2 doesn't work for you.
>
> 4. **Cancel** — exit."

Top-level routing:

| Selection | Action |
|---|---|
| Option 1 | Phase 4.0 (with pre-call confirmation gate). `ACTION_TAKEN = "fast-path-platform-getorcreate"`. |
| Option 2 | Show the Custom-Host sub-prompt at Step 2 below. |
| Option 3 | Phase 4.C. `ACTION_TAKEN = "user-created-custom-ppac"`. |
| Option 4 | Exit. |

**Step 2: build the eligible-env list and apply role labels** (only needed when the user picks Option 2 → sub-option `a`; do this lazily after Option 2 is selected).

Take `RESOLUTION.candidates.eligibleForAppInstall[]` from Phase 2 (envs with Dataverse, caller has access, Pipelines NOT yet installed, sku ∈ default filter — `{Production, Sandbox}`; widen to `Production,Sandbox,Trial` via `--skus` for trial-license tenants).

For each entry, decorate with project-context labels at presentation time. Match by **URL origin** (lowercase, trailing slash stripped, path/query ignored). Multiple labels join with ` · `.

| Label | Source signal |
|---|---|
| `dev env` | The env URL the skill is running against (`devEnvUrl` from caller / `pac env who`) |
| `source env` | `sourceEnvironmentUrl` from `docs/alm/last-pipeline.json` (typically same env as dev) |
| `staging env` | `targetEnvironmentUrl` of any stage in `docs/alm/last-pipeline.json` whose stage name matches `/stag\|test\|uat/i` |
| `production env` | `targetEnvironmentUrl` of any stage whose name matches `/prod/i` |

Envs with no role match show without a label.

<!-- not-a-gate: methodology discussion (how Step 2 formats the prompt list) — no new prompt; the actual env-pick gate is the 3.C / 3.D host-type prompt elsewhere in Phase 3 -->

**Step 2a: rank and cap the eligible-env list.** `AskUserQuestion` becomes unusable past about 7–8 options. Apply a **5-env presentation cap** with role-aware ranking:

1. **Always-visible role-labeled envs** (highest priority): include any eligible env that carries a `dev env`, `source env`, `staging env`, or `production env` label from Step 2's role decoration. Dedupe by URL origin.
2. **Fill remaining slots up to 5** from the rest of the eligible list, in `list-tenant-envs.js`'s native order (name-hint pattern → admin-perms → lastModifiedTime).
3. **Always append** an "Other (paste URL)" entry as the last item.

Track the total eligible count separately — when `eligible.length > 5`, surface the gap inline.

**Step 2b: empty-list collapse.** If the eligible list has zero entries after the filters, first try widening the SKU filter to include Trial (re-invoke `ensure-pipelines-host-detect.js` with `--skus Production,Sandbox,Trial`). If still zero, **drop sub-option `a`** from the Custom-Host sub-prompt — present only `b` (create new) and `c` (Back). Print the SKU-filter detail so the user can override:

> *"No existing environments matched the SKU filter (Production, Sandbox, Trial). Run `--skus <comma-list>` to widen further, or pick `b` to create a brand-new env, or `c` to go back."*

**Step 2c: present the Custom-Host sub-prompt** (when user picks Option 2):

> "How would you like to set up the Custom Host?
>
> a. **Use an existing environment** — install the Pipelines app on it.{eligibleCountSuffix} Pick from your eligible envs:
>    - `{env[0].displayName}` (`{env[0].instanceApiUrl}`) — `{environmentSku}` — *{labels if any}*
>    - `{env[1].displayName}` (...)
>    - … (up to 5 entries)
>    - *Other (paste URL) — for any eligible env not on this short list*
>
>    *⚠ Sandbox-sku envs trigger a confirmation prompt before install.*
>
> b. **Create a brand-new dedicated env** — automated env-create with template `D365_ProjectHost`. Pipelines app pre-installed. Requires Global / Power Platform / Dynamics admin. ~5–10 min.
>
> c. **Back** — return to the top-level host-type menu."

`{eligibleCountSuffix}` substitution rules:
- `eligible.length <= 5` → empty string (no suffix; all envs visible).
- `eligible.length > 5` → ` Showing top 5 of {N}; the remaining {N-5} eligible env(s) can be reached via the "Other (paste URL)" entry.` (leading space).

When the user picks "Other (paste URL)", **pre-fill** the URL input with `pac env list --output json` results so they can paste-or-pick from the full tenant inventory rather than typing a URL by hand.

**Test scenarios to verify when changing this prompt:**
- 0 eligible → sub-option `a` dropped (sub-prompt shows only `b` / `c`).
- 1–5 eligible → list all inline, no suffix.
- 6+ eligible with role-labeled envs (dev/staging/prod) present → all role-labeled envs surface first; remaining slots filled by ranking; suffix shows count gap.
- 6+ eligible with NO role-labeled envs → top 5 by ranking; suffix shows count gap.

**Step 3: route the sub-prompt answer.**

| Selection | Phase 4 path | `ACTION_TAKEN` |
|---|---|---|
| Option 1 (top-level Platform Host) | **4.0** (pre-call confirmation, then `provision-platform-host.js`) | `"fast-path-platform-getorcreate"` |
| Option 2 → sub-option `a` — picked env from list, URL matches `devEnvUrl` (origin-equal) | **4.B** (skip the "which env" sub-prompt; pass the picked env URL through as `CHOSEN_ENV_URL`) | `"user-installed-app-on-dev"` |
| Option 2 → sub-option `a` — picked any other listed env | **4.B** (skip sub-prompt; pass `CHOSEN_ENV_URL`) | `"user-installed-app"` |
| Option 2 → sub-option `a` — "Other (paste URL)" | **4.B** with user-supplied URL as `CHOSEN_ENV_URL` | `"user-installed-app"` |
| Option 2 → sub-option `a` — picked env where `environmentSku === "Sandbox"` | **Step 4 Sandbox confirmation gate**, then 4.B if confirmed | (deferred until confirmation) |
| Option 2 → sub-option `b` | **4.A** (sub-prompts: name, region, admin confirmation) | `"fast-path-custom-d365projecthost"` |
| Option 2 → sub-option `c` (Back) | re-show top-level menu | n/a |
| Option 3 | **4.C** | `"user-created-custom-ppac"` |
| Option 4 | exit | n/a |

For Option 1 and sub-option `b`, a **non-skippable pre-call confirmation gate** echoes the tenant identity before firing. Option 1 → see Phase 4.0 "Pre-call confirmation". Sub-option `b` → see Phase 4.A "Pre-call confirmation (NON-SKIPPABLE)".

**Step 4 (conditional): Sandbox confirmation gate.**

If the env picked in sub-option `a` has `environmentSku === "Sandbox"`, present:

> "⚠ `{displayName}` is a **Sandbox** env (`environmentSku: Sandbox`).
>
> Power Platform Pipelines is documented to run on Production envs. Sandbox should work but isn't on the supported matrix.
>
> Proceed?
> 1. Yes, proceed at my own risk
> 2. Pick a different env
> 3. Cancel"

- Yes → continue to 4.B with the Sandbox env. Set `ACTION_TAKEN` per the dev-env-match rule above.
- Pick a different env → re-show sub-option `a`'s env list (keep the rest of the picker state).
- Cancel → back to the top-level Phase 3.C prompt.

**Telemetry note.** Splitting `"user-installed-app"` and `"user-installed-app-on-dev"` lets us see, after rollout, how often users co-locate Pipelines with their dev env vs. dedicating a separate env. The new `"fast-path-platform-getorcreate"` value lets us measure adoption of the new lowest-friction path; the `telemetry.platformHostAlreadyExisted` flag in the artifact distinguishes idempotent-existing (200) from newly-provisioned (202) outcomes — useful for tuning Phase 2.5's `--maxEnvsToProbe` defaults if we see Phase 4.0 hitting 200 frequently.

#### 3.D — Status `HostWithoutPipelines` (rare)

Host env exists but Pipelines solution is missing.

> "Found host environment `{finalHostEnvUrl}` but the Pipelines solution is not installed. Install it now via PPAC?
> 1. Yes — open PPAC and install (guided manual)
> 2. No — exit"

- Yes → Phase 4.C with pre-selected env.
- No → exit.

#### 3.E — Status `OrgSettingStale` / `PermissionDenied`

Surface the specific failure to the user. Out of automated remediation scope. Recommend manual cleanup.

### Phase 4 — Execute chosen path

#### 4.0 — Fast-path: Platform Host via `getOrCreate`

<!-- gate: ensure-pipelines-host:4.0.pre-call | category=consent | cancel-leaves=nothing -->

> 🚦 **Gate (consent · ensure-pipelines-host:4.0.pre-call):** Echo the tenant identity in the request body before firing the BAP `getOrCreate` Platform Host call. NON-SKIPPABLE even when upstream `hostResolution.willProvisionPlatform === true`. PE is tenant-singleton and admin-non-deletable — this gate is the principal wrong-tenant mitigation.
>
> **Trigger:** Phase 4.0 entry (routed in from 3.C or upstream).
> **Why we ask:** PE provisioned in wrong tenant; cannot be deleted by tenant admin.
> **Cancel leaves:** Nothing — no provisioning fired yet.

The lowest-friction host-provisioning path. Calls the idempotent BAP `getOrCreate` endpoint with a `D365_1stPartyAdminApps` + `Platform` body. Same call `make.powerapps.com → Pipelines` page makes when a user clicks "Get started" — we just invoke it directly. Spec from `useGetOrCreatePlatformEnvironment.v4.ts`. New helper `provision-platform-host.js`.

**No sub-prompts.** BAP picks tenant home geo + default display name; no admin role required.

**Pre-call confirmation via `AskUserQuestion`** — NON-SKIPPABLE single consent gate:

> "About to provision a Platform Host for tenant **{TENANT_DISPLAY_NAME}** (`{tenantId}`).
>
> A Platform Host is a Microsoft-managed Dataverse environment in your tenant's home region. One per tenant, idempotent — if you already have one, it'll be returned. New provisioning takes about 3–5 minutes.
>
> Proceed? 1. Yes / 2. Cancel"

(When `TENANT_DISPLAY_NAME` is null, drop the bold tenant-name segment and lead with the tenant GUID.)

**Why this gate runs even when upstream `hostResolution.willProvisionPlatform === true`** — same rationale as 4.A's pre-call gate: this echoes the *exact tenant identity*, the user's last chance to catch a wrong-tenant operation. PE is tenant-singleton and admin-non-deletable; the gate is the principal mitigation. Implementation details (BAP endpoint, body shape) are intentionally kept out of the user-facing prompt and live in this SKILL.md / `provision-platform-host.js` source.

**Call:**

```bash
node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/provision-platform-host.js" \
  --bapToken "{BAP_TOKEN}" \
  --correlationId "{uuid v4}"
```

**Response handling** (delegated to the helper, but the routing decision lives here):

- `200` + `properties.provisioningState === 'Succeeded'` → tenant already had a PE (idempotent path). Helper returns `{ status: 'Succeeded', alreadyExisted: true, instanceApiUrl, ... }`. Set `RESOLUTION.finalHostEnvUrl`, `finalHostEnvId`, `RESOLUTION.isPlatform = true`, `actionTaken = "fast-path-platform-getorcreate"`, `telemetry.platformHostAlreadyExisted = true`. Continue to Phase 5. *Defensive note:* this means Phase 2.5 enumeration missed the PE (probably because `--maxEnvsToProbe` capped before the PE was reached, or a race between Phase 2 and 4.0). Surface a debug-level note; don't fail.
- `202` + Location → helper polls until `provisioningState === 'Succeeded'` and returns `{ status: 'Succeeded', alreadyExisted: false, instanceApiUrl, ... }`. Set the same fields with `telemetry.platformHostAlreadyExisted = false`.
- `403` → helper throws with the BAP body verbatim; recommend `az logout && az login`. Offer fallback to Options 2/3/4. (Do NOT reuse the 4.A admin-required copy — getOrCreate does not require admin.)
- `4xx` / `5xx` other → helper throws; surface, ask retry or switch path.

**On success:** `RESOLUTION.isPlatform = true` (so Phase 5 takes the JIT branch — Constraint 1). Proceed to Phase 5.

#### 4.A — Fast-path: Custom Host via `D365_ProjectHost` template

<!-- gate: ensure-pipelines-host:4.A.pre-call | category=consent | cancel-leaves=nothing -->

> 🚦 **Gate (consent · ensure-pipelines-host:4.A.pre-call):** Echo the BAP env-create request body (region + display name + template) before firing the Custom Host create call. NON-SKIPPABLE even when upstream `hostResolution.willProvisionCustom === true`. Last chance to catch a wrong-tenant/wrong-region provisioning. Bug fixed 2026-05-05 was caused by skipping this gate.
>
> **Trigger:** Phase 4.A entry; sub-prompts (display name, region, admin attestation) collected.
> **Why we ask:** Custom Host provisioned in wrong tenant or wrong region; consumes Azure capacity quota; potentially attributes the env to the wrong organization.
> **Cancel leaves:** Nothing — no provisioning fired yet.

<!-- gate: ensure-pipelines-host:4.sandbox-confirm | category=consent | cancel-leaves=nothing -->

> 🚦 **Gate (consent · ensure-pipelines-host:4.sandbox-confirm):** When the picked install-target env has `environmentSku=Sandbox`, surface the sandbox-limits warning and require explicit re-confirmation before installing. Fires once per Sandbox-SKU env selected.
>
> **Trigger:** Phase 4.B / Phase 3.C sub-option a — picked env is Sandbox SKU.
> **Why we ask:** Installing Pipelines onto a Sandbox env without consent — sandbox envs are deletable on inactivity and have reduced capacity; pipelines may break unexpectedly.
> **Cancel leaves:** Nothing — no app install fired.

Standard env-create API with the `D365_ProjectHost` template (eng.ms-documented; same template PPAC `New custom host` uses internally). New helper `provision-custom-host.js`.

**Sub-prompts (collected before the API call) via `AskUserQuestion`:**

1. Display name (default suggestion: `"{tenant displayName} Pipelines Host"`)
2. Region (default: tenant home geo from BAP `tenant` endpoint; offer override)
3. Confirm caller is admin — single AskUserQuestion *"Are you a Global / Power Platform / Dynamics admin in this tenant? Yes / No / Not sure"*. If No or Not sure, recommend Path 4.B/4.C and fall back.

**Pre-call confirmation via `AskUserQuestion`** — NON-SKIPPABLE second consent gate:

> "About to call `POST https://api.bap.microsoft.com/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/environments?api-version=2021-04-01` for tenant `{tenantId}` with body:
> ```json
> {

>   }
> }
> ```
> Provisions a Custom Host with the Pipelines app pre-installed (~5–10 min). Proceed? 1. Yes / 2. Cancel"

> **This gate must always run.** Do NOT skip it because plan-alm Q4 already received a "continue with PP Pipelines" confirmation, or because `hostResolution.willProvisionCustom === true` upstream, or because the user said yes to the admin attestation moments earlier. plan-alm Q4 and the admin attestation are about *strategy*; this gate echoes the *exact API call body* (URL, region, tenant, template) and is the user's last chance to catch a wrong-tenant or wrong-region provisioning. The bug fixed on 2026-05-05 surfaced precisely because the agent treated the plan-alm pre-confirmation as covering this gate.

**Call:**

```
POST https://api.bap.microsoft.com/providers/Microsoft.BusinessAppPlatform/environments?api-version=2021-04-01

}
```

**Response handling:**

- `202` + `Location` header + `Retry-After` header → poll the Location URL until lifecycle op completes.
- `200` + immediate body (rare for env-create) → capture URLs.
- `403` from initial POST → stop with *"Custom Host fast-path requires Global / Power Platform / Dynamics admin. Suggest Path 2 (Pipelines app on existing env) if you have system-admin on a Dataverse env, or Path 3 (PPAC UI) if you can request admin assistance."* Offer seamless fallback to 4.B / 4.C.
- `409` with a capacity-related code (e.g. `NotEnoughCapacity_HasTrialLicense_ProvisionEnvironment`, `NotEnoughCapacity`, `NotEnoughCapacity_OrganizationDisabled`, `EnvironmentCapacityExceeded`) → **offer a SKU-fallback prompt before falling back to Path 4.B**. The license / capacity constraint usually applies only to the requested SKU; smaller SKUs (Sandbox, Developer, Trial) often succeed on the same tenant and produce a Pipelines host that works identically (the Pipelines app installs on any SKU — only license allocation differs). See sub-step "4.A — SKU fallback prompt" below. Only after the user declines a SKU fallback OR the fallback also fails should we re-enter Phase 3.C / Path 4.B.
- 4xx / 5xx other → surface error, ask user to retry or switch path. On switch to 4.B, follow the same "use original eligible-env list" rule above.

**Polling:**

```
GET {Location}
Authorization: Bearer {BAP_TOKEN}
```

Interval = `Retry-After` seconds (default 10s). Timeout = 15min (configurable). On each response, read `provisioningState` (and/or operation `state` field — confirm during execution):
- `Creating` / `InProgress` → continue polling
- `Succeeded` → done; capture `instanceApiUrl`, `name` (env GUID), `displayName`
- `Failed` / `Canceled` → surface error, stop

**On success:** set `RESOLUTION.finalHostEnvUrl`, `finalHostEnvId`, `instanceApiUrl`, `actionTaken = "fast-path-custom-d365projecthost"`. Proceed to Phase 5.

##### 4.A — SKU fallback prompt (capacity-error remediation)

When env-create returns a 409 capacity-related error, the user's tenant doesn't have spare license/capacity for the requested SKU but may have it for a smaller SKU. Surface the constraint clearly and offer fallback SKUs **before** suggesting Path 4.B:

1. Read the error body. Extract:
   - `error.code` (e.g. `NotEnoughCapacity_HasTrialLicense_ProvisionEnvironment`)
   - `error.message` (the human-readable explanation from BAP, e.g. *"Trial licenses are limited to creating Trial environments only."*)

2. Build the fallback SKU list. The default order is **Production (recommended) → Sandbox → Developer → Trial**, dropping the SKU that just failed. Each SKU carries a different caveat:

   | SKU | When to suggest | Caveat to surface |
   |---|---|---|
   | `Production` | Default first choice | None — the documented Pipelines host SKU |
   | `Sandbox` | Tenants with subscription but no spare Production capacity | *"Sandbox SKU works for Pipelines but is documented as non-production. Microsoft may apply different SLAs to Sandbox-hosted apps."* |
   | `Developer` | Individual-developer tenants | *"Developer SKU is single-user. Other team members will not be able to deploy through this host. Use only if this is a personal/dev-only ALM setup."* |
   | `Trial` | Trial-license tenants (no other option works) | *"Trial environments expire after 30 days unless converted. The Pipelines host will need to be re-provisioned at expiry."* |

3. Tell the user the constraint and present the prompt:

   > "Custom Host provisioning failed with `{error.code}`: {error.message}
   >
   > The Pipelines app installs identically on any SKU — only the license allocation differs. You can retry env-create with a smaller SKU, or fall back to installing the Pipelines app on an existing env (Path 4.B)."

   <!-- gate: ensure-pipelines-host:4.A.sku-fallback | category=plan | cancel-leaves=nothing -->
   > 🚦 **Gate (plan · ensure-pipelines-host:4.A.sku-fallback):** Capacity error on env-create — retry with different SKU, fall back to Path 4.B (install on existing env), or cancel.

   `AskUserQuestion` (build the option list dynamically — drop the SKU that just failed, append the caveats inline):

   | Question | Header | Options |
   |---|---|---|
   | Retry env-create with a different SKU? | SKU fallback | (one option per remaining SKU, with caveat in the description), Fall back to Path 4.B (install Pipelines app on existing env), Cancel |

4. Branch on the answer:
   - **Picked SKU**: re-issue the 4.A pre-call confirmation gate (NON-SKIPPABLE — see "Pre-call confirmation" above) with the new SKU substituted into the body, then re-call `provision-custom-host.js` with `--environmentSku <picked>`. If that also fails with a capacity error, present the prompt again with the next SKU dropped. After two consecutive capacity failures, stop offering SKU fallbacks and route to Path 4.B.
   - **Path 4.B**: route to 4.B per the "original eligible-env list" rule below.
   - **Cancel**: exit cleanly.

   **Always** discard any env GUID returned in the 409 response body — provisioning failed, so the GUID either doesn't represent a usable env or is an artifact. Path 4.B must use the Phase 2 eligible-env inventory exclusively.

#### 4.B — Install Pipelines app on an existing env (automated)

This path was previously a manual click-through to PPAC. As of 2026-05-08 it's fully automated: `install-pipelines-app.js` calls the BAP `applicationPackages/install` endpoint (the same API that backs PPAC's *"Install app"* button) and falls back to `pac application install` when BAP returns 401/403/5xx.

**Sub-prompt: pick the target env (skipped when env is already chosen):**

1. **If the env was already chosen** (`CHOSEN_ENV_URL` is set, either from Phase 3.C Option 2 → sub-option `a` OR from the upstream skip rule on `hostResolution.chosenEnvUrl`): skip the sub-prompt — proceed directly to the install step with the chosen env. Set `ACTION_TAKEN` per the Phase 3.C Step 3 routing table (`"user-installed-app-on-dev"` when `CHOSEN_ENV_URL` origin matches `devEnvUrl`, else `"user-installed-app"`).

   **Otherwise** (legacy entry path — caller invoked 4.B directly without going through 3.C, or arrived here via the 4.A failure fallback): present the sub-prompt *"Which env will host Pipelines? (Auto-detected envs from Phase 2 inventory):"* with the eligible-for-app-install list **from `RESOLUTION.candidates.eligibleForAppInstall[]`** as choices, plus "Other (paste URL)". When arriving from 4.A's 409 trial-license fallback, the eligible list still applies — discard any env GUID surfaced in the 409 response body.

> **Env GUID sanity check.** The GUID passed to the install helper must come from the chosen env's `name` field as enumerated in Phase 2 (or from `pac env list` for a user-pasted URL). Never substitute a GUID from a 4.A failure response, from `docs/alm/last-host-check.json` of a different run, or from any other state path. If you cannot determine the GUID with confidence, ask the user to confirm via `AskUserQuestion` showing the env display name + URL + GUID before invoking the helper.

**Pre-call confirmation gate** (NON-SKIPPABLE — same rationale as Phase 4.0 / 4.A):

> "About to install the **Power Platform Pipelines** application on `{displayName}` (`{instanceApiUrl}`) in tenant **{TENANT_DISPLAY_NAME}** (`{tenantId}`). This is the same install PPAC's *Install app* button performs — the agent calls the BAP API directly so no manual click-through is needed. Takes ~2–5 minutes. Proceed? 1. Yes / 2. Cancel"

**Call the helper:**

```bash
node "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lib/install-pipelines-app.js" \
  --bapToken "{BAP_TOKEN}" \
  --envId "{envId}" \
  --instanceApiUrl "{instanceApiUrl}" \
  --hostToken "{HOST_TOKEN}" \
  --correlationId "{uuid}"
```

`HOST_TOKEN` is acquired against the chosen env's origin (`az account get-access-token --resource "{instanceApiUrl origin}"`) and passed through so the helper's post-install verification probe (`solutions?$filter=uniquename eq 'msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor'`) can run end-to-end without the skill having to chain a separate verification step.

**Response handling** (delegated to the helper, but routing decisions live here):

- `{ status: 'Succeeded', alreadyInstalled: true, installPath: 'cached' }` — the package was already installed on this env (idempotent path; rare in 4.B since Phase 2.5 should have classified the env as a host already, but defensive). Set `ACTION_TAKEN` per the dev-env-match rule above and proceed to Phase 5.
- `{ status: 'Succeeded', alreadyInstalled: false, installPath: 'bap' }` — the BAP `applicationPackages/install` POST succeeded (200 sync or 202 + Location poll). Set `ACTION_TAKEN` per the dev-env-match rule above and proceed to Phase 5.
- `{ status: 'Succeeded', alreadyInstalled: false, installPath: 'pac', pacFallbackReason: '...' }` — BAP returned 401/403/5xx (typically token-audience mismatch in tenants where Az → BAP is rejected, same scenario `pac-bap-shim.js` covers for env enumeration); the helper fell through to `pac application install`. Same outcome, log the fallback reason in `docs/alm/last-host-check.json` telemetry. Proceed to Phase 5.
- Helper throws — both BAP and PAC failed. Surface the combined error message to the user. **Last-resort fallback** (manual): print the PPAC URL `https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/manage/environments/{envId}/dynamics365apps` and the four manual steps (*Install app → Power Platform Pipelines → Next → accept terms → Install*) with a follow-up *"Done — proceed"* AskUserQuestion. After confirmation, run `verify-host-readiness.js` against the env URL and proceed to Phase 5 only when the Pipelines solution is detected. This branch should be rare; if it fires often, file an issue with the helper's combined error so we can tune the BAP/PAC paths.

**On success:** capture the helper's `pipelinesSolutionVersion` (populated when `instanceApiUrl` + `hostToken` were passed). Set `RESOLUTION.finalHostEnvUrl/Id`. Proceed to Phase 5.

#### 4.C — Guided manual: PPAC `New custom host`

<!-- gate: ensure-pipelines-host:4.C.ppac-done | category=progress | cancel-leaves=host-binding -->

> 🚦 **Gate (progress · ensure-pipelines-host:4.C.ppac-done):** External-system wait gate — user must complete the PPAC "New custom host" flow manually, then return to confirm. Skill polls BAP afterward for the new env.
>
> **Trigger:** Phase 4.C entry; PPAC URL printed.
> **Why we ask:** Skill proceeds without confirming the new env exists; downstream `setup-pipeline` then fails with no host. Worse, if PPAC creation succeeded partway and the user cancelled the gate, the host binding is partially established (a `D365_ProjectHost`-templated env exists in tenant).
> **Cancel leaves:** `host-binding` — a manually-created env may be left in tenant; user must clean up via PPAC.

1. Print: `https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/deployments` and instructions: *"Click 'New custom host' → fill name (suggested: '{tenant} Pipelines Host') → choose Production environment in tenant home region → Create. Provisioning takes 5–10 min."*

   > Per eng.ms doc: *"the panel will default to the Production environment type. Adding Dataverse is also required... template and sample apps options are hidden here, as we use a specific organization template for this scenario."* (The template is `D365_ProjectHost` — same one Path 4.A automates.)

2. Two-option `AskUserQuestion`: *"Done — provisioning kicked off"* / *"Cancel"*.
3. After confirmation, poll BAP `list-tenant-envs.js` every 15s looking for a new env with the Pipelines marker. On detection, capture URLs, `actionTaken = "user-created-custom-ppac"`. Proceed to Phase 5.

#### Common: Timeout handling

15-min default per path (configurable). On timeout: ask user to extend (another 15min), switch path, or exit.

### Phase 5 — JIT-provision (PE-detected only) and verify host

Always runs, regardless of how `finalHostEnvUrl` was obtained.

**JIT step (only when an existing PE was detected and selected — `RESOLUTION.isPlatform === true`):** Per Constraint 2, the calling user may have been JIT-provisioned in the PE long ago, or never. To ensure auth works on the host before we hand off, we issue one `WhoAmI` against `instanceApiUrl`. (The same step is required for Custom Host paths but is naturally satisfied by `verify-host-readiness.js` step 1 below — admin who created the env has access by construction; for `user-installed-app` the user already had access to the env.)

```
GET {instanceApiUrl}/api/data/v9.0/WhoAmI
Authorization: Bearer {HOST_TOKEN}
```

Where `HOST_TOKEN = az account get-access-token --resource "{instanceApiUrl origin}"`.

Expected: 200 with `UserId`. If 404 / 403 on first call: retry every 5s up to 60s — JIT propagation is sometimes async.

**Verification (`verify-host-readiness.js`)** — checks in order:

1. `WhoAmI` returns `UserId` (proves auth — and triggers JIT for PE detection case).
2. `GET {hostEnvUrl}/api/data/v9.0/solutions?$filter=uniquename eq 'msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor'&$select=version&$top=1` returns one row → capture `PIPELINES_SOLUTION_VERSION`. (One query covers both Pipelines-installed check AND version capture; `deploymentpipelines?$top=0` rejected by Dataverse with 400.)

Compare against `MIN_PIPELINES_VERSION` (constant in `scripts/lib/alm-thresholds.js`).

- All checks pass → `READY = true`.
- Solution version below minimum → emit a warning (non-fatal).
- Any check fails → stop with check-specific remediation.

### Phase 6 — Write host-check artifact

Write `docs/alm/last-host-check.json` (create the `docs/alm/` directory first if missing — `node -e "require('fs').mkdirSync('docs/alm',{recursive:true})"`; or use `--outputPath` when invoked outside a project):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "checkedAt": "2026-04-28T...",
  "tenantId": "...",
  "sourceEnvUrl": "{devEnvUrl}",
  "sourceEnvId": "...",
  "resolutionStatus": "AvailableUsingPlatformHost" | "AvailableUsingCustomHost" | "AvailableUsingCustomHostByAdminDefault" | "AvailableUnboundCustomHost" | "MultipleUnboundCustomHosts" | "PlatformHostExistsUnbound" | "CannotRedirect" | "NoHost" | "OrgSettingStale" | "PermissionDenied" | "HostWithoutPipelines",

  "pipelinesSolutionVersion": "9.x.y.z",
  "ready": true,
  "warnings": [
    "Pipelines solution version 9.0.0.1 is below recommended 9.1.0.0 — RetrieveDeploymentPipelineInfo may not be available."
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "existingCustomHosts": [
      { "envId": "...", "instanceApiUrl": "...", "displayName": "...", "pipelinesSolutionVersion": "..." }
    ],
    "existingPlatformHost": null,
    "eligibleForAppInstall": [
      { "envId": "...", "instanceApiUrl": "...", "displayName": "..." }
    ],
    "inaccessibleEnvs": [
      { "envId": "...", "displayName": "...", "reason": "403" }
    ]
  },
  "telemetry": {
    "correlationId": "{uuid passed to env-create, if applicable}",
    "platformHostAlreadyExisted": true | false
  }
}
```

> **`telemetry.platformHostAlreadyExisted`** — only present when `actionTaken === "fast-path-platform-getorcreate"`. `true` when the BAP `getOrCreate` returned 200 + `Succeeded` (idempotent — tenant already had a PE); `false` when the call returned 202 and we polled to completion. Lets us measure how often Phase 2.5 enumeration misses an existing PE so we can tune `--maxEnvsToProbe` defaults.

> **Schema version bump (1 → 2):** added `candidates.*` block to record the tenant-wide enumeration result. Cache fast-path (Phase 1 step 0) reads `finalHostEnvUrl` regardless of schemaVersion; the candidates block is informational and helps debug / re-run decisions. Old v1 files remain readable — any missing field is treated as "not yet enumerated".

> **`actionTaken` enum — value definitions:**
> - `"none"` — host already established before this run; no install/provision performed (Phase 3.A path or cache fast-path).
> - `"reuse-existing-custom"` — user picked an unbound Custom Host that already existed in the tenant (Phase 3.C-pre or 3.C-pre').
> - `"reuse-existing-pe"` — user picked the existing Platform Host (Phase 3.C-pre'').
> - `"fast-path-platform-getorcreate"` — Phase 4.0 invoked the BAP `getOrCreate` endpoint. The `telemetry.platformHostAlreadyExisted` flag distinguishes idempotent-existing (200) vs. newly-provisioned (202) outcomes.
> - `"fast-path-custom-d365projecthost"` — Phase 4.A provisioned a new Custom Host via the env-create API.
> - `"user-installed-app"` — Phase 4.B installed Pipelines on an existing env that is **not** the same as the dev env.
> - `"user-installed-app-on-dev"` — Phase 4.B installed Pipelines on the **dev env itself** (URL origin matches `devEnvUrl`). Telemetry-distinct from `"user-installed-app"` so we can see how often users co-locate Pipelines with their dev env.
> - `"user-created-custom-ppac"` — Phase 4.C — user created the env via the PPAC UI; flow detected it post-create.

## Integration with existing skills

### setup-pipeline (✅ wired)

`setup-pipeline/SKILL.md` Phase 1 step 4 calls `ensure-pipelines-host-detect.js` (the orchestrator wrapper) and branches on `resolutionStatus`:
- `AvailableUsing*` → use `finalHostEnvUrl` directly, continue.
- `*Unbound*` / `NoHost` → delegate to `/power-pages:ensure-pipelines-host` (this skill) for reuse-or-provision; resume after `docs/alm/last-host-check.json` shows `ready: true`.
- `CannotRedirect` / `OrgSettingStale` / `PermissionDenied` → stop with the specific admin-resolution message.

The old "ask user for host URL manually" fallback in Phase 3 has been removed — `HOST_ENV_URL` is always populated by Phase 1, or the skill stops before Phase 3.

### deploy-pipeline

No change. `deploy-pipeline` reads `hostEnvUrl` from `docs/alm/last-pipeline.json` written by `setup-pipeline`.

### plan-alm (✅ wired)

`plan-alm` Phase 1 step 12 invokes `ensure-pipelines-host-detect.js` and stores the result as `HOST_RESOLUTION` (skipped when `PIPELINE_DONE = true`). Phase 2 Q4 branches on `HOST_RESOLUTION.status`. The generated `docs/alm-plan.html` includes a "Pipelines Host" card and (when `willEnsureDuringExecution: true`) a sub-bullet under the "Setup pipeline" checklist step. See `references/cicd-pipeline-patterns.md` and the `plan-alm-update-PLAN.md` spec.

## Threat model — built-in mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation in this skill |
|---|---|
| Confused-deputy / silent provisioning | Phase 1.4 tenant identity gate + Phase 3 explicit choice + Phase 4.A pre-call confirmation echoing the exact request body |
| Duplicate host creation | Phase 2.5 tenant-wide enumeration finds any existing Custom Host before Phase 3 offers to create. Phase 3.C-pre / 3.C-pre' surface existing hosts for reuse. User must explicitly decline reuse (option "No") to reach the create-new tree. |
| Stale local cache → using a deleted host | Phase 1.0 cache fast-path validates with a live `solutions?$filter=uniquename eq 'msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor'&$top=1` probe before reusing — 404/403/timeout falls through to full Phase 2 |
| 404 ambiguity → unintended action | Phase 2.2 disambiguation rule — never act on a single 404; corroborate with list-tenant-envs |
| Wrong-tenant provisioning | Phase 1.4 echoes tenantId, organizationId, and dev env URL; Phase 4.A echoes tenantId in the pre-call body |
| `CannotRedirect` masked | Phase 2.3 explicitly detects this and stops with a specific error rather than continuing into a wrong-host write |
| JIT-provisioning miss → silent 404 chains | Phase 5 makes WhoAmI call against `instanceApiUrl` before any other host op (relevant when an existing PE was detected) |
| Stale solution → silent failure | Phase 5 reads `PIPELINES_SOLUTION_VERSION` and warns if below `MIN_PIPELINES_VERSION` |
| Non-admin tries Custom Host fast-path | Phase 4.A pre-prompts for admin role; gracefully falls back to Phase 4.B / 4.C on 403 |
| Tenant-singleton PE created accidentally | Phase 1.4 tenant-identity gate (echoes tenant display name + tenant ID + dev env URL) + Phase 4.0 pre-call confirmation gate (echoes tenant display name + tenant ID again, immediately before the call). The `getOrCreate` endpoint is idempotent — calling it on a tenant that already has a PE returns the existing one (200 + `alreadyExisted = true`) rather than creating a duplicate. |
| Telemetry leakage | All probe results stay in `docs/alm/last-host-check.json`; correlation ID is the standard `x-ms-correlation-id` UUID we generated; `update-skill-tracking.js` writes only counters + authoring-tool name |
| Privilege boundary | All paths run in user OAuth context; 403/401 surfaces as a stop with "this requires X admin role" message; no escalation attempted |
| Rate-limit | 15-min total timeout per path; respect `Retry-After` from BAP; minimum 10s poll interval |
| Force-link irreversibility | Out of scope — see *What this skill does NOT do* |

## Key decision points (wait for user)

1. **Phase 1.4** — Tenant identity confirmation (read-only intent)
2. **Phase 3.A/B/C-pre/C-pre'/C-pre''/C/D/E** — Branch decision based on `RESOLUTION.status`
3. **Phase 3.C-pre** — Reuse single existing Custom Host (Y/N/Cancel)
4. **Phase 3.C-pre'** — Pick from multiple existing Custom Hosts or create new
5. **Phase 3.C-pre''** — Use existing PE or create Custom Host instead
6. **Phase 3.C** — Create-new path selection (4 options: Custom-fast, app-install, PPAC-UI, cancel)
7. **Phase 4.A** — Admin-role self-attestation (No / Not sure → fall back to 4.B / 4.C)
8. **Phase 4.A** — Pre-call confirmation echoing exact API request body
9. **Phase 4.B/C** — User performs UI step → confirms back via "Done — proceed"
10. **Phase 5** — Warning acknowledgement if Pipelines solution version is below minimum

## Error handling

- `verify-alm-prerequisites.js` fails → stop with remediation (`az login`, `pac auth create`)
- BAP token acquisition fails → stop; suggest `az logout && az login`
- BAP env GET returns 404 → run disambiguation (Phase 2.2 fallback)
- BAP env GET returns 403 → `RESOLUTION.status = "PermissionDenied"`, surface tenant ID + env ID, stop
- Custom Host env-create returns 403 → seamless fallback to 4.B (app install) or 4.C (PPAC UI)
- Custom Host env-create returns 4xx other → log status + body, ask user to retry or switch path
- Lifecycle-op polling timeout (15 min default) → ask: extend (another 15min) / switch path / exit
- `RetrieveSetting` returns 404 → treated as "no admin default custom host" (current `discover-pipelines-host.js` behavior)
- `GetOrgDbOrgSetting` returns 404 → treated as "not bound" (matches UI behavior)
- WhoAmI on host returns 403 after JIT retries → likely `CannotRedirect` race or genuine perm issue; stop with both error message
- `verify-host-readiness.js` reports `Pipelines tables not found` after user-claimed install (4.C) → ask user to recheck PPAC or extend polling

## Open items (resolve during execution phase)

These need real-environment validation:

1. ~~**Pipelines solution `uniquename`.**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-28**: confirmed `msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor` v9.1.2026034.260325188 via live query against SIP host (`pascalepipelineshost.crm.dynamics.com`). Stored as `PIPELINES_SOLUTION_UNIQUE_NAME` constant.
2. **`MIN_PIPELINES_VERSION`.** Set after testing which Pipelines features fail on the lowest in-the-wild solution version. Initial conservative guess: `"9.0.0.0"`.
3. ~~**Custom Host detection marker in `list-tenant-envs.js`.**~~ ✅ **RESOLVED 2026-04-28**: confirmed via live BAP env-list query (1000 envs in test tenant) — `linkedEnvironmentMetadata.templates` is **never returned** even with `$expand=properties.linkedEnvironmentMetadata`. Per-env Dataverse probe is mandatory. Probe query corrected to `solutions?$filter=uniquename eq 'msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor'&$select=version&$top=1` (covers presence + version in one call). PE detection still straightforward via `environmentSku === 'Platform'`.
4. **`BapApiVersion` value for env-create.** The `D365_ProjectHost` template was onboarded for Pegasus / BAP-RP / Neptune (per eng.ms PR list). The PPAC UI uses `2021-04-01` for env operations. Confirm during execution by capturing a fresh HAR from `New custom host`.
5. **Lifecycle-op response shape.** Need to confirm whether the Location URL returns `{ properties: { provisioningState } }` or `{ state }` or both. To be HAR'd.
6. **Tenant home geo discovery.** Default region for 4.A. Options: `BAP_TOKEN` claims (`tid`, `xms_tcdt`?), BAP `/tenant?api-version=2021-04-01` endpoint, or `properties.azureRegionHint` from existing envs. Pick one during execution.
7. **Cold-tenant test env.** Need a tenant with no prior Pipelines usage to validate end-to-end. A personal MSDN tenant works.
8. **BAP env-list filter on `linkedEnvironmentMetadata.templates`?** If supported, we can pre-filter to envs created with `D365_ProjectHost` and skip the per-env Dataverse probe in Phase 2.5b. To be tested. If unsupported, the per-env probe with bounded concurrency stands.
9. **Does env-list response actually include `linkedEnvironmentMetadata.templates`?** If yes, even without server-side filter we can client-filter cheaply. If no, the per-env Dataverse probe is the only signal. Verify by capturing a fresh BAP env-list HAR including the `$expand=properties.linkedEnvironmentMetadata` query parameter (already used by `resolve-env-by-id.js`).
10. ~~**Per-env probe rate-limit budget.**~~ ✅ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED 2026-04-28**: Microsoft-internal test tenant has 1000 envs (526 Production sku, 453 Sandbox). Naïve probe-all is too slow even with 10-concurrent. Adopted multi-tier filter:
    - Pre-filter envs without Dataverse (recovers ~3 envs in test tenant — minor)
    - Filter by `--skus` (default `Production`; PE always included)
    - Sort by `lastModifiedTime` desc
    - Cap at `--maxEnvsToProbe` (default 50; ~5s wall time at 10-concurrent)
    - Surface "scanned N of M (filter: ...)" warning when cap is hit and no host found
    Remaining: validate cap defaults against typical customer tenants (5–50 envs) — should be no-op overhead there.
11. **`cacheMaxAgeMs` default.** 24h is a starting guess. May need tightening if hosts change frequently in dev tenants. Make it configurable via `--cacheMaxAgeHours` and document.

## Scripts

All shipped under `plugins/power-pages/scripts/lib/` (or as noted). Each is single-purpose Node, parses argv, uses `validation-helpers.js` for HTTPS, prints JSON to stdout.

| Script | Purpose | Args | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `check-env-host-binding.js` | `POST GetOrgDbOrgSetting('ProjectHostEnvironmentId')` on the source env | `--envUrl`, `--token` | `{ bound, hostEnvId }` |
| `resolve-env-by-id.js` | BAP env GET with `$expand=properties.linkedEnvironmentMetadata,properties.permissions`, with PAC shim fallback on 401/403. | `--source` (`auto`\|`bap`\|`pac`; default `auto`), `--bapToken` (required for `bap`), `--envId` | `{ found, envId, instanceUrl, instanceApiUrl, displayName, environmentSku, isManaged, permissions, sourceUsed, fallbackReason, ... }`; on 404 returns `{ found: false, reason: "404-ambiguous" }`; on PAC-not-listed returns `{ found: false, reason: "not-in-pac-list" }` |
| `pac-bap-shim.js` | Wraps `pac admin list --json` into a BAP-shaped env-list. Used as fallback when Az→BAP returns 401 (some tenants reject Az CLI's first-party client ID for BAP). Derives `instanceApiUrl` from `EnvironmentUrl`; maps PAC's `Type` → BAP's `environmentSku`. Cannot surface PE (PAC doesn't list Platform-sku envs); BAP-only fields (`tenantId`, `lastModifiedTime`, `permissions`) are returned as `null`. | n/a (CLI prints all envs) | BAP-shaped env array |
| `list-tenant-envs.js` | List + per-env Pipelines-presence probe (`solutions?$filter=uniquename eq 'msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor'&$select=version&$top=1`), parallel max 10 concurrent. Pre-filter: sku + has-Dataverse + optional `--includeName`. Ranking: name-hint pattern + admin-perms + recency. Cap: `--maxEnvsToProbe` (default 30). | `--source` (`auto`\|`bap`\|`pac`; default `auto`), `--bapToken` (required for `bap`), `--skus` (default `Production`; PE always included), `--maxEnvsToProbe`, `--maxConcurrency`, `--probeTimeoutMs`, `--includeName`, `--firstHitWins` | `{ existingCustomHosts[], existingPlatformHost, eligibleForAppInstall[], inaccessibleEnvs[], inaccessibilityBreakdown, totalEnvsInTenant, envsAfterFilter, envsProbed, hitProbeCap, earlyExitOnFirstHit, probeDurationMs, sourceUsed, fallbackReason }` |
| `verify-host-readiness.js` | `WhoAmI` (proves auth + triggers JIT in PE-detection path) → solutions filter for `msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor` (one call covers presence + version) | `--hostEnvUrl`, `--hostToken`, `--skipWhoAmI` (opt), `--minPipelinesVersion` (opt) | `{ ready, pipelinesSolutionVersion, checks: { whoami, solutions }, warnings[] }` |
| `provision-custom-host.js` | POST BAP env-create with `D365_ProjectHost` template + `Production` sku + `CommonDataService` databaseType. Polls lifecycle op via `Location` header at `Retry-After` interval. Handles `properties.provisioningState` / `state` / `status.code` shapes. 5xx-transient retry. 401/403 with explicit guidance. | `--bapToken`, `--displayName`, `--region`, `--correlationId` (opt), `--timeoutSec` (opt, default 900), `--apiVersion` (opt, default 2021-04-01) | `{ status, envId, instanceUrl, instanceApiUrl, displayName, environmentSku, provisioningState, durationSec, correlationId, pollAttempts, locationHeader }` |
| `provision-platform-host.js` | POST BAP `getOrCreate` with `D365_1stPartyAdminApps` template + `Platform` sku. Returns `alreadyExisted: true` on the 200 idempotent path (existing PE returned) or `alreadyExisted: false` on the 202 + Location-poll path (newly provisioned). Used by Phase 4.0. | `--bapToken`, `--correlationId` (opt), `--timeoutSec` (opt, default 600), `--apiVersion` (opt, default `2021-04-01`), `--bapBase` (opt) | `{ status, alreadyExisted, envId, instanceUrl, instanceApiUrl, displayName, environmentSku, provisioningState, durationSec, correlationId, pollAttempts, locationHeader }` |
| `install-pipelines-app.js` | Discover + install the Power Platform Pipelines application package on an existing env. Resolution: BAP `applicationPackages` LIST + `/install` POST → 200 sync / 202 + Location poll, with PAC CLI fallback on 401/403/5xx (`pac application install --environment-id ... --application-list msdyn_AppDeploymentAnchor`). 409 on install POST treated as idempotent (already-installed). Optional post-install Dataverse verification probe. Used by Phase 4.B (replaced the manual PPAC click-through on 2026-05-08). | `--bapToken`, `--envId`, `--instanceApiUrl` (opt — for verification), `--hostToken` (opt — for verification), `--no-pac-fallback` (opt; default: PAC fallback enabled), `--correlationId` (opt), `--timeoutSec` (opt, default 600), `--apiVersion` (opt, default `2022-03-01-preview`), `--bapBase` (opt) | `{ status, alreadyInstalled, installPath: 'bap'\|'pac'\|'cached', packageUniqueName, pipelinesSolutionVersion, durationSec, correlationId, pollAttempts, locationHeader, pacFallbackReason }` |
| `ensure-pipelines-host-detect.js` | Detection-only orchestrator wrapper. Runs Phase 1.0 (cache fast-path) + Phase 2 (resolution order including tenant-wide enumeration) + Phase 5 (verify if host found). Always emits `actionTaken: "none"`. Used by `plan-alm` Phase 1 and `setup-pipeline` Phase 1. **`--source auto` (default) tries BAP first; on 401/403 falls back to PAC CLI shim** — works in tenants where Az CLI tokens are rejected by BAP. | `--envUrl`, `--token`, `--userId`, `--bapToken` (optional with `--source auto` or `pac`), `--source` (`auto`\|`bap`\|`pac`), `--projectRoot`, `--cacheMaxAgeHours` (opt), `--no-cache`, `--includeName`, `--maxEnvsToProbe`, `--skus`, `--minPipelinesVersion` | `docs/alm/last-host-check.json` schema (with `sourceUsed`, `fallbackReason`) |
| `validate-ensure-host.js` (skill `scripts/`) | PostToolUse Stop-hook validator. Schema v1+v2 forward-compat. Treats `CannotRedirect` / `OrgSettingStale` / `PermissionDenied` as documented terminal-error states (skill ran successfully even if host isn't usable). | n/a (reads stdin JSON `{cwd}`) | exit 0 (approve) or exit 2 (block) |

Existing helpers reused (no changes):
- `verify-alm-prerequisites.js`
- `detect-project-context.js`
- `discover-pipelines-host.js` (the tenant-default-custom-host probe; called from Phase 2 step 3 inside the wrapper)
- `update-skill-tracking.js`

## Validation script

`skills/ensure-pipelines-host/scripts/validate-ensure-host.js` (PostToolUse Stop hook, registered via `TRACKED_SKILLS` in `scripts/lib/powerpages-hook-utils.js`):

- If no `docs/alm/last-host-check.json` in cwd → exit 0 (not an ensure-host session).
- If present: validate `schemaVersion === 1` or `2` (forward-compatible); required fields populated (`tenantId`, `sourceEnvUrl`, `resolutionStatus`); `ready === true` for non-terminal-error statuses; `finalHostEnvUrl` populated when `ready === true`.
- Terminal-error statuses (`CannotRedirect` / `OrgSettingStale` / `PermissionDenied`) are accepted with `ready: false` — the skill ran successfully and surfaced a state requiring manual / admin resolution.
- The `candidates` block (v2) is optional — its absence does not fail validation.

The companion prompt-hook checks:
1. Either (a) Phase 1.0 cache fast-path succeeded and we reused the cached host, OR (b) the full flow ran:
   - Tenant identity gate was confirmed.
   - `RESOLUTION.status` was determined via the full resolution order including tenant-wide enumeration when source env was unbound.
   - If status was `AvailableUnbound*`, `MultipleUnboundCustomHosts`, or `PlatformHostExistsUnbound`, the user explicitly chose reuse-or-create-new.
   - If status indicated provisioning was needed (`NoHost`), an explicit user-chosen path completed (`actionTaken` is one of the `fast-path-*`, `user-installed-*`, or `user-created-*` values — i.e. not `"none"` and not `"reuse-existing-*"`).
2. `verify-host-readiness.js` reported `ready: true` (or a documented terminal-error state was reached).
3. `docs/alm/last-host-check.json` was written with `schemaVersion: 2` and the `candidates` block populated when tenant-wide enumeration ran.
4. Summary was presented.
