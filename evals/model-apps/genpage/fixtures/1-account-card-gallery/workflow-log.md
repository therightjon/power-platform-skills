# Workflow Log — Eval 1: Account card gallery

## Phase 0 — Working directory setup
- Working directory created: `account-card-gallery/` (kebab-case derived from "account card gallery")
- Plugin root: `D:\Projects\power-platform-skills\plugins\model-apps`

## Phase 1 — Planner (genpage-planner agent invoked via Task)

### Prereq checks
- `node --version` → v20.11.0
- `pac help` → PAC CLI Version 2.7.3 (>= 2.7.0 verified)
- (Run separately, not chained with &&)

### Auth check
- `pac auth list` → active profile aurora365-user1@auroratstgeo.onmicrosoft.com
- Active environment: https://aurorabapenv4ab3f.crm10.dynamics.com/ (reported to user)

### Entity discovery
- `pac model list-tables --search 'account'` — Account entity detected as existing (exact logical-name match: `account`)

### Discovery questions (AskUserQuestion)
- Question 1 (new or edit): user answered "Create new page(s)"
- Question 2 (data source): user answered "Dataverse entities: account"
- Question 3 (specific requirements): "Responsive card layout, each card clickable to open the Account record"
- Question 4 (app selection): user selected existing app "Sales Hub"

### Solution selection
- Build is code-only (no new entities, no new app) → solution selection question SKIPPED
- Default values written to plan: `Solution: Default`, `Publisher Prefix: new`

### Plan presented
- EnterPlanMode called; user approved plan

### Plan written
- genpage-plan.md written; conforms to references/plan-schema.md (all required headings present)

## Phase 2 — Entity creation
- SKIPPED (account exists)
- check-auth.js not invoked (no entity work required)
- genpage-entity-builder not invoked

## Phase 3 — App creation
- SKIPPED (existing app "Sales Hub" selected)

## Phase 4 — Schema generation
- `pac model genpage generate-types --data-sources 'account' --output-file account-card-gallery/RuntimeTypes.ts`
- RuntimeTypes.ts written

## Phase 5b — Single-page fast path
- Plan has 1 page → fast path taken (inlined build, no Task subagent dispatched for the page-builder)
- Data mode: dataverse
- Read sample: plugins/model-apps/samples/7-responsive-cards.tsx (closest match for card layout)
- Read ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/verified-icons.txt to source icon names
- Wrote page.tsx
- Post-write icon verification: grep `from "@fluentui/react-icons"` in page.tsx; verified `BuildingRegular`, `MailRegular`, `PhoneRegular`, `GlobeRegular` against verified-icons.txt — all present

## Phase 6 — Deployment
- `pac model genpage upload --app-id 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc --code-file account-card-gallery/page.tsx --data-sources 'account' --prompt "Build a page showing Account records as a gallery of cards. Include name, website, email, phone number. Make the gallery scrollable and each card clickable to open the Account record." --model claude-sonnet --name "Accounts Gallery" --agent-message "Account card gallery with click-to-open" --add-to-sitemap`
- Upload succeeded; page-id = abc12345-...

## Phase 8 — Summary
- 1 page deployed: page.tsx → "Accounts Gallery" in Sales Hub app
- No entities created, no app created
