# Workflow Log — Eval 4: Multi-step case wizard

## Phase 0 — Working directory setup
- Working directory created: `new-case-wizard/` (kebab-case derived from "new case wizard")
- Plugin root: `D:\Projects\power-platform-skills\plugins\model-apps`

## Phase 1 — Planner (genpage-planner agent invoked via Task)

### Prereq checks
- `node --version` → v20.11.0
- `pac help` → PAC CLI Version 2.7.3 (>= 2.7.0 verified)

### Auth check
- `pac auth list` → active profile aurora365-user1@auroratstgeo.onmicrosoft.com
- Active environment: https://aurorabapenv4ab3f.crm10.dynamics.com/ (reported to user)

### Entity discovery
- `pac model list-tables --search 'incident,contact'` — both entities detected as existing (exact logical-name matches: `incident`, `contact`)

### Discovery questions (AskUserQuestion)
- Question 1 (new or edit): user answered "Create new page(s)"
- Question 2 (data source): skipped because prompt specifies incident + contact directly
- Question 3 (specific requirements): "3-step wizard with Next/Back navigation, form validation, review before submit"
- Question 4 (app selection): user selected existing app "Service Hub"

### Solution selection
- Build is code-only (no new entities, no new app) → solution selection question SKIPPED
- Defaults written to plan: `Solution: Default`, `Publisher Prefix: new`

### Plan presented
- EnterPlanMode called; user approved plan

### Plan written
- genpage-plan.md written; conforms to references/plan-schema.md

## Phase 2 — Entity creation
- SKIPPED (incident, contact exist)
- check-auth.js not invoked
- genpage-entity-builder not invoked

## Phase 3 — App creation
- SKIPPED (existing app selected)

## Phase 4 — Schema generation
- `pac model genpage generate-types --data-sources 'incident,contact' --output-file new-case-wizard/RuntimeTypes.ts`

## Phase 5b — Single-page fast path
- Plan has 1 page → fast path taken (inlined build, no Task subagent dispatched)
- Data mode: dataverse
- Read sample: plugins/model-apps/samples/2-wizard-multi-step.tsx (wizard pattern reference)
- Read ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/verified-icons.txt to source icon names
- Wrote page.tsx (~7 KB)
- Post-write icon verification: grep `from "@fluentui/react-icons"` in page.tsx; verified `PersonRegular`, `DocumentRegular`, `CheckmarkCircleRegular` against verified-icons.txt — all present

## Phase 6 — Deployment
- `pac model genpage upload --app-id 22222222-1111-2222-3333-444444444444 --code-file new-case-wizard/page.tsx --data-sources 'incident,contact' --prompt "Build a multi-step wizard form for creating new Case records. Step 1: customer info. Step 2: case details (title, priority, category). Step 3: review and submit. Use the incident and contact tables." --model claude-sonnet --name "New Case Wizard" --agent-message "3-step case creation wizard with contact and incident creation" --add-to-sitemap`
- Upload succeeded

## Phase 8 — Summary
- 1 page deployed: page.tsx → "New Case Wizard" in Service Hub
- No entities created, no app created
