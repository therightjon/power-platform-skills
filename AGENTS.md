# Power Platform Skills - Development Guidelines

This file provides guidance to AI Agents when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A **plugin marketplace** for Power Platform development by Microsoft. The marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) references individual plugins in `plugins/`. Each plugin has its own `AGENTS.md` with plugin-specific guidance.

## Local Development

Test a plugin locally by launching your AI agent with the plugin path:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/plugins/<plugin-name>
```

No root-level build, lint, or test commands exist. Build/test tooling lives inside each plugin.

## Plugin Conventions

Each plugin follows this structure:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Plugin metadata (name, version, keywords)
- `.mcp.json` — MCP server configuration (optional)
- `agents/` — Agent definitions (`.md` files with YAML frontmatter)
- `skills/` — Skill definitions, each in its own subdirectory with a `SKILL.md`
- `scripts/` — Shared utility scripts referenced by skills and agents
- `references/` — Shared reference documents used by multiple skills

Skills are defined in `SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools, model, hooks). The `allowed-tools` field must use a **comma-separated list** (e.g., `allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep`) — not JSON array syntax (`["Read", "Write"]`) or YAML list syntax. Each skill may include validation scripts in a `scripts/` subdirectory, run as Stop hooks when the skill session ends.

## Cross-Plugin Shared Skills

Skills that apply to all plugins live in `shared/skills/<skill-name>/`. The workflow logic is written once in a shared `.md` file, and each plugin has a thin `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` that contains only the YAML frontmatter and a reference to the workflow path bundled inside that plugin at install time.

**Pattern:**
- `shared/skills/<skill-name>/<workflow>.md` — Full workflow (phases, instructions, field definitions)
- `shared/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.template.md` — Template SKILL.md (frontmatter + reference to workflow); supports `{{PLUGIN_NAME}}` placeholder
- `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` — Per-plugin wrapper generated from the template above
- `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/<workflow>.md` — Symlink to the shared workflow when the plugin must work after installing only its own plugin directory

This keeps the skill discoverable in each plugin while preserving install-time portability. Marketplace installs copy only the plugin directory, so per-plugin wrappers must not reference repo-root `shared/` paths at runtime. Instead, point the wrapper at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<skill-name>/<workflow>.md` and keep a symlink from that per-plugin path to the repo-root shared workflow; marketplace installers dereference same-marketplace symlinks into the installed plugin cache. When updating a shared skill, edit the workflow file and/or `SKILL.template.md` in `shared/`, then update the per-plugin wrappers (frontmatter + bundled workflow reference, with `{{PLUGIN_NAME}}` substituted) and ensure any per-plugin symlinks still resolve under `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/`. Commit the shared source and per-plugin symlinks together.

## Shared Telemetry

1DS telemetry code for all plugins lives at `shared/telemetry/`. Each adopting plugin **symlinks** the library into its own tree — `plugins/<plugin>/scripts/lib/telemetry/lib` is a symlink to `shared/telemetry/lib`. The marketplace installer dereferences that symlink into the installed plugin at install time, so the shared code ships without copying it into each plugin. Each plugin keeps its own real `ikey.json` next to the symlink.

Edit `shared/telemetry/` directly — the symlink makes changes live for every adopting plugin immediately; there is nothing to re-sync.

Per-plugin iKey/collector routing is pluggable via a `resolver.js` placed next to the plugin's `ikey.json` (implementing the `resolve`/`isProvisioned` contract); the shared library ships only that contract plus a static-key fallback, not any routing logic.

Current adopters: `power-pages`. Others adopt on demand.

## Code Conventions

**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Never duplicate logic across files. Each plugin has shared utilities (e.g., `scripts/lib/`) and shared reference docs (e.g., `references/`). Always check for and reuse existing helpers before writing new code. When adding shared logic, put it in the plugin's shared modules — not in individual skill directories.

## Maintaining This File

When you add new plugins or change the repository-level structure, update this file. For plugin-specific changes, update the plugin's own `AGENTS.md` (e.g., `plugins/power-pages/AGENTS.md`).
